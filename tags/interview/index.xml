&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bismuthcoin.org/images/2020-01-18/interview.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
&lt;strong>Q&amp;amp;A session&lt;/strong> with &lt;em>wBismuth&lt;/em> Developer &lt;strong>Nyzblossom&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the past months, most of the crypto sphere has gone Uniswap crazy.
Uniswap, based upon ETH smart contracts and running on Ethereum chain only, is a DEX allowing any token to be listed and exchanged, with a fast growing ecosystem and derivatives.
The usual “when moon” on many discords were then replaced by “when Uniswap”?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On September 14 EggPool asked Twitter for feedback:
&lt;img src="https://bismuthcoin.org/images/2020-11-04/wbismuth-interview-002.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The related &lt;a href="https://x.com/EggPoolNet/status/1305432898116497408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter thread&lt;/a> does provide several meaningful and useful answers, please check them 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, a third party developer team just said “let’s do it”.
Bismuth is permission-less, the code is open, there are various repositories with integration and app examples: anyone can build on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>The Interview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-interview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-interview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hello Nyzblossom, so you’re the developer behind wBIS, a wrapped BIS token on Eth blockchain and were kind enough to answer our questions, welcome!&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Let begin with the basics: can you tell us what your experience in the crypo field is?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-let-begin-with-the-basics-can-you-tell-us-what-your-experience-in-the-crypo-field-is">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-let-begin-with-the-basics-can-you-tell-us-what-your-experience-in-the-crypo-field-is" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: I am a crypto enthusiast since the early days.
I am mainly speculator investor and researcher.
I hired my good friend who is a coder to write wBIS to BIS gateway&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: What led you to Bismuth?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-led-you-to-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-led-you-to-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: I discovered it few months after it’s Mainnet started loved the specs and started mining it then later set masternodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Long time fan then, cool! Do you have previous experience at wrapping tokens, What made you want to wrap Bismuth on Eth?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-long-time-fan-then-cool-do-you-have-previous-experience-at-wrapping-tokens-what-made-you-want-to-wrap-bismuth-on-eth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-long-time-fan-then-cool-do-you-have-previous-experience-at-wrapping-tokens-what-made-you-want-to-wrap-bismuth-on-eth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: The developer doesn’t have previous experience at wrapping tokens but is familiar with writing contracts on ether.
I wanted to wrap Bismuth on Eth for several reasons :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Taking advantage of Uniswap for Bismuth needs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make Bis more trad-able and liquid&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make Bis more popular&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To remove the need for any type of registration in order to buy Bis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To find a solution for connecting Bis to ether in a trust less way and make it in a pro active way&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I might be saying something wrong but this is my spirit: I think that if bismuth team can create solution for running masternodes in a trust less way then we will be able to run our ether -&amp;gt; bismuth and visa versa gateway also in a trust less way by holding the underlying bis used to create wBIS in this masternodes ” – does it make sense?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: This raises a lot of rather technical questions that would not fit in this Q&amp;amp;A, but definitely worth digging into!&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-this-raises-a-lot-of-rather-technical-questions-that-would-not-fit-in-this-qa-but-definitely-worth-digging-into">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-this-raises-a-lot-of-rather-technical-questions-that-would-not-fit-in-this-qa-but-definitely-worth-digging-into" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Can you describe the workflow of the whole process, $BIS to $wBIS and the other way around? What will it look like, from a user point of view?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A: Any transaction received by us on one of the networks (Eth, Bis) is credited on the other network.
From a Bismuth user point of view, the user needs to fill the data field of the transaction with his Ethereum address.
From an Ethereum user point of view, the user need to visit our website with Metamask and fill amount of token and Bismuth receive address.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Any fee in the process?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-any-fee-in-the-process">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-any-fee-in-the-process" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: Yes, there will be a fee of 20 Bis on deposit transactions (BIS -&amp;gt; wBis) to cover gas cost on Ethereum. No fee on withdraw transactions (wBis -&amp;gt; BIS).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Was diving into the Bismuth interface part easy, any stuff we could improve?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-was-diving-into-the-bismuth-interface-part-easy-any-stuff-we-could-improve">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-was-diving-into-the-bismuth-interface-part-easy-any-stuff-we-could-improve" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: I wouldn’t say we dived into the Bismuth interface. Let’s say we touched the surface. It was an ok experience.
Parts of the documentation are fragmented and disorganized.
Unifying the Bismuth knowledge base into a single place may be beneficial for new comers.
Establishing and publishing coding standards and guidelines, will probably improve the overall wholeness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Thanks for the advice!&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-thanks-for-the-advice">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-thanks-for-the-advice" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>The dev time itself looked quite small, can you give us some feedback on how that was shared and what needed the most time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A: It’s simple and very minimal. The Bismuth side already had everything we needed (data field in each transaction).
So we only needed to watch transactions for a specific address and send specific transactions from that address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Ethereum we added a modified erc20 transfer function, which added a data field to the transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is the time spent in each area of development.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bismuth – installation, configuration, receive tx, send tx – 20%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ethereum – installation, configuration, receive tx, send tx – 20%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solidity – erc20 modification , contract deployments – 20%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Static HTML – Metamask web3 interface – 10%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Control Center – database of transactions – 30%&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4>Q: We saw you planned some maximum amount of wrapped Bismuth and a time limit as well. Can you tell us more and why?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-we-saw-you-planned-some-maximum-amount-of-wrapped-bismuth-and-a-time-limit-as-well-can-you-tell-us-more-and-why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-we-saw-you-planned-some-maximum-amount-of-wrapped-bismuth-and-a-time-limit-as-well-can-you-tell-us-more-and-why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: the reason for the maximum amount of wrapped Bis (200k Bis) is because it’s alpha version and there are lots of things that can go wrong and we don’t feel comfortable holding big sums of Bis for our users .
The time limit on our operation is also because we don’t want to attract big Bismuth holders and after 3 month we will decide what to do next .&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Now, let’s get into the core stuff. If I got it right, the workflow is not decentralized nor trustless yet, so there’s an entity acting as custodian? Who is involved?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-now-lets-get-into-the-core-stuff-if-i-got-it-right-the-workflow-is-not-decentralized-nor-trustless-yet-so-theres-an-entity-acting-as-custodian-who-is-involved">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-now-lets-get-into-the-core-stuff-if-i-got-it-right-the-workflow-is-not-decentralized-nor-trustless-yet-so-theres-an-entity-acting-as-custodian-who-is-involved" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: Yes, there is a custodian Bismuth node that holds the underlying Bis used to issue wBIS (erc20 tokens)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Can you tell us more about your operational security? How many different keys are involved, Who has control over them, What measure did you enforce to make sure they are safe from both loss and hackers?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-can-you-tell-us-more-about-your-operational-security-how-many-different-keys-are-involved-who-has-control-over-them-what-measure-did-you-enforce-to-make-sure-they-are-safe-from-both-loss-and-hackers">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-can-you-tell-us-more-about-your-operational-security-how-many-different-keys-are-involved-who-has-control-over-them-what-measure-did-you-enforce-to-make-sure-they-are-safe-from-both-loss-and-hackers" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A:Two keys are involved (One Bismuth, one Ethereum).
They are located at the control center box, and backed up in two separate physical locations.
The box is running a bismuth node, and communicates with the Ethereum blockchain via Infura.
The static HMTL is hosted on gitlab.io .
We are lacking front facing web pages for users to interact with.
We do not have logins nor passwords.
Our only interaction with our users is via the blockchain.
Having such a minimal form of interaction with our users makes our attack surface exceptionally small.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: A word for our users, what can you say to help them feel safe and use the bridge?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-a-word-for-our-users-what-can-you-say-to-help-them-feel-safe-and-use-the-bridge">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-a-word-for-our-users-what-can-you-say-to-help-them-feel-safe-and-use-the-bridge" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: I can’t say it’s safe to use the bridge, because it’s alpha version and there might be all kinds of bugs&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Are there formal guarantees you can give with respect to the bis or wbis funds safety?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-are-there-formal-guarantees-you-can-give-with-respect-to-the-bis-or-wbis-funds-safety">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-are-there-formal-guarantees-you-can-give-with-respect-to-the-bis-or-wbis-funds-safety" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>A: No&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Let say other entities or users would like to run such a bridge, will you release the needed code as open source?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-let-say-other-entities-or-users-would-like-to-run-such-a-bridge-will-you-release-the-needed-code-as-open-source">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-let-say-other-entities-or-users-would-like-to-run-such-a-bridge-will-you-release-the-needed-code-as-open-source" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Yes, we will make it open source and others also will be able to run it if they choose.
We plan to release the source code after first two weeks of operation.
We need to close some potential security holes first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Q: Thanks a lot Nyzblossom!&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-thanks-a-lot-nyzblossom">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-thanks-a-lot-nyzblossom" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>The Bismuth foundation is pretty happy with this experiment.
This is a definitive proof the open and permission-less nature of Bismuth leads to third parties building on top of Bismuth and bringing tools the community values.
We are very grateful for the work that was done by the wBis team and wish them a great success!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>References&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="references">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#references" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>wBIS has a &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/PqZdHg65dm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated Discord&lt;/a>, operated by wBIS team (not Bismuth Foundation)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>wBIS should officially launch on November 9 2020.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
As stated along the interview: the wBIS bridge is not operated by the Bismuth foundation, and the Bismuth team members have absolutely no control over the bridge, nor related BIS and ETH keys. There is nothing we could do in case of something going wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BisBabble Interview - ShadowCrypto</title><link>https://bismuthcoin.org/blog/2020-02-07-interview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bismuthcoin.org/blog/2020-02-07-interview/</guid><description>

Welcome to another edition of &lt;strong>BisBabble&lt;/strong>! In this episode, we chat with &lt;strong>ShadowCrypto&lt;/strong>, a dedicated &lt;strong>Bismuth supporter&lt;/strong> and key contributor to the &lt;strong>Pawer bot&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The Interview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-interview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-interview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;h4>Q: Hello Shadow! We heard about you in a previous BisBabble episode. You are a vibrant supporter of Bismuth and a much-appreciated code contributor to the Pawer bot. Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-hello-shadow-we-heard-about-you-in-a-previous-bisbabble-episode-you-are-a-vibrant-supporter-of-bismuth-and-a-much-appreciated-code-contributor-to-the-pawer-bot-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself">&lt;/span>

&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Since forums don’t allow for direct observation, how do you describe yourself at dinner parties?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-since-forums-dont-allow-for-direct-observation-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-since-forums-dont-allow-for-direct-observation-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> As an &lt;strong>introvert&lt;/strong>, I prefer to stay silent and focus on the main purpose—&lt;strong>eating, a lot!&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Well, introvert maybe, but you were the one who brought @aravindballa to the party—thanks for that! How did you get into programming in the first place?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-well-introvert-maybe-but-you-were-the-one-who-brought-aravindballa-to-the-partythanks-for-that-how-did-you-get-into-programming-in-the-first-place">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-well-introvert-maybe-but-you-were-the-one-who-brought-aravindballa-to-the-partythanks-for-that-how-did-you-get-into-programming-in-the-first-place" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I have an interesting backstory for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When I finished school and had to choose a field of study, I told my cousin, &lt;strong>“Anything except computers.”&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A couple of years later, I ended up doing my &lt;strong>undergraduate degree in Computer Science&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I &lt;strong>never regretted it&lt;/strong>—every day was fun!&lt;br>
I first encountered coding through coursework and was &lt;strong>fascinated&lt;/strong> by how &lt;strong>a few lines of code&lt;/strong> could perform &lt;strong>complex tasks&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
That simple realization keeps me &lt;strong>motivated&lt;/strong> to this day.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: The preferred minimalism can be seen in your code. So, programming is your day job?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-the-preferred-minimalism-can-be-seen-in-your-code-so-programming-is-your-day-job">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-the-preferred-minimalism-can-be-seen-in-your-code-so-programming-is-your-day-job" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Yes, I &lt;strong>pay my bills&lt;/strong> with programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Like many others—&lt;strong>through Bitcoin&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Initially, I was interested in &lt;strong>crypto as an investment&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At first, &lt;strong>Bitcoin’s technical details were overwhelming&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Over time, I took the time to &lt;strong>understand it better&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I still don’t know &lt;strong>everything in detail&lt;/strong>, but I now have a &lt;strong>decent high-level understanding&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What’s the piece of code you’re most proud of?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-the-piece-of-code-youre-most-proud-of">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-the-piece-of-code-youre-most-proud-of" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Back when I was &lt;strong>new to HTML &amp;amp; CSS&lt;/strong>, I worked on &lt;strong>email templates&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I migrated existing templates to &lt;strong>plain HTML &amp;amp; CSS/SASS&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reduced &lt;strong>1700 lines of code to 450&lt;/strong> per template.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supported all browsers &amp;amp; mail clients.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There were &lt;strong>10 such templates&lt;/strong> in total!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It was a great &lt;strong>learning and implementation experience&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Minimalism again! What programming languages have you worked with?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-minimalism-again-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-minimalism-again-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong> &amp;amp; &lt;strong>Java&lt;/strong> (mostly).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>C/C++?&lt;/strong> Still unsure if I should count them—I started with them but didn’t continue afterward.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What led you to Bismuth?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-led-you-to-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-led-you-to-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>@cryptotyrion&lt;/strong> introduced me to Bismuth.&lt;br>
The fact that it was &lt;strong>written in Python&lt;/strong> (my favorite language) made me &lt;strong>dig deeper&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I’ve been an &lt;strong>investor/trader since 2017&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest strength?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>The devs.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m amazed at how &lt;strong>hard and smart they work&lt;/strong>, even in the toughest times.&lt;br>
Also, the &lt;strong>community is incredibly welcoming&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bismuth was my &lt;strong>first open-source contribution&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
At first, I had &lt;strong>many fears&lt;/strong> about where to start, but the &lt;strong>devs made it easy&lt;/strong> and were &lt;strong>super helpful&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
It’s a &lt;strong>perfect learning environment&lt;/strong> for blockchain development—especially in &lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Thanks! We try to be welcoming because we need contributors like you—and you’ve proved yourself! What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest weakness?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-thanks-we-try-to-be-welcoming-because-we-need-contributors-like-youand-youve-proved-yourself-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-weakness">&lt;/span>

&lt;p>I may be &lt;strong>wrong or less informed&lt;/strong>, but I don’t fully understand how &lt;strong>Bismuth generates money&lt;/strong> within its ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: You’ve mainly worked on the Pawer Discord bot. Are there other parts of Bismuth’s ecosystem you’d like to explore?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-youve-mainly-worked-on-the-pawer-discord-bot-are-there-other-parts-of-bismuths-ecosystem-youd-like-to-explore">&lt;/span>

I’d love to explore:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ZircoDice&lt;/strong> 🎲&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dragginator&lt;/strong> 🐉&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other &lt;strong>DApps&lt;/strong> 🚀&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I also want to &lt;strong>build my own DApp&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
If anyone has &lt;strong>ideas and needs a partner, hit me up!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Most loved programming language &amp;amp; why?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-loved-programming-language--why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-loved-programming-language--why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong>—as simple as &lt;strong>writing a few statements in English&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Most hated programming language &amp;amp; why?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-hated-programming-language--why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-hated-programming-language--why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I haven’t figured that out yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: You’ll live longer if you only love and don’t hate—good call! On a more personal note, what are you up to when you’re not coding?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-youll-live-longer-if-you-only-love-and-dont-hategood-call-on-a-more-personal-note-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-youll-live-longer-if-you-only-love-and-dont-hategood-call-on-a-more-personal-note-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I’m a &lt;strong>photographer at heart&lt;/strong>—that’s what keeps me alive. 📷&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love finding &lt;strong>patterns, symmetry, and silhouettes&lt;/strong> in unexpected places.&lt;br>
Also, I won a &lt;strong>national-level award&lt;/strong> and received a &lt;strong>few other recognitions&lt;/strong>—making my parents proud at a young age.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Do you see any connections between photography and coding?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-do-you-see-any-connections-between-photography-and-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-do-you-see-any-connections-between-photography-and-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Great question!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, &lt;strong>programming is also an art form&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People express &lt;strong>creativity in different ways&lt;/strong>—programming is one of them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Photography and coding &lt;strong>share similarities&lt;/strong>—composing a &lt;strong>shot&lt;/strong> vs. composing a &lt;strong>function&lt;/strong>,&lt;br>
keeping things &lt;strong>minimal&lt;/strong>, finding &lt;strong>patterns&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>reusing&lt;/strong> them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both give me the &lt;strong>same dopamine hit&lt;/strong>—whether I &lt;strong>capture a great photo&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>write a beautiful script&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Your best piece of programming advice?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>💡 &lt;strong>Programming is evolving fast&lt;/strong>—it takes just a few days to start learning a language (especially Python).&lt;br>
💡 &lt;strong>You can automate daily tasks or build fun projects—just for fun!&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
💡 &lt;strong>Not everything you learn has to make money—enjoy programming!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://bismuthcoin.org/images/2020-01-18-interview.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
In this second issue of the &lt;strong>“BisBabble”&lt;/strong> series we welcome &lt;strong>Endogen&lt;/strong>, a long-time Bismuth supporter and developer of the &lt;strong>Bismuth Telegram Bot, Bauer&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>📝 The Interview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="-the-interview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#-the-interview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Sure! I’m a &lt;strong>38-year-old software engineer from Germany&lt;/strong>, but I’ve only been in the software industry for about &lt;strong>8 years&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Before that, I worked as a &lt;strong>retail salesman for an electronics retailer&lt;/strong>, but I didn’t enjoy it—so I decided to &lt;strong>study Software Engineering&lt;/strong> 🙂.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a kid, I was naturally drawn to the &lt;strong>internet&lt;/strong> and fascinated by &lt;strong>software&lt;/strong>. Unlike everything else that seemed to decay over time, software &lt;strong>stayed the same&lt;/strong>—I found that really interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I work as a &lt;strong>SAP consultant&lt;/strong>, helping companies implement &lt;strong>SAP ME (Manufacturing Execution)&lt;/strong> to create &lt;strong>paperless plants&lt;/strong>. Unfortunately, I no longer code at work, but I still love it and do it privately for fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: How do you describe yourself at dinner parties?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I &lt;strong>don’t&lt;/strong>. I prefer to stay in the background and listen to people 😉.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if I had to, I’d say I’m &lt;strong>drawn to things outside the mainstream&lt;/strong>. Life is too short to be bored by &lt;strong>mediocre stuff&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
For example, I’ve always been fascinated by &lt;strong>psychoactive drugs, consciousness, and philosophical theories&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
However, after having &lt;strong>two kids&lt;/strong>, responsibility took over—but I’m sure I’m still &lt;strong>strange as hell&lt;/strong> 😆.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s what I’d say at a dinner party. And the &lt;strong>one or two people still cool with me after that?&lt;/strong> Those are the ones I’d have a beer with.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What made you want to start coding?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-made-you-want-to-start-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-made-you-want-to-start-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I love the idea of &lt;strong>creating something from nothing&lt;/strong>. Software is especially interesting because of its &lt;strong>unique properties&lt;/strong>—once it exists, it can be &lt;strong>used anywhere by anyone&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that &lt;strong>someone can write code, publish it on GitHub, and people worldwide can use it&lt;/strong> fascinates me.&lt;br>
I believe &lt;strong>proprietary software will become niche&lt;/strong> in the future—so everything I code privately will always be &lt;strong>open source&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Is programming your day job or a hobby?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> It was my &lt;strong>day job for a short time&lt;/strong>, but now it’s just a &lt;strong>hobby&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
I’m not the &lt;strong>best&lt;/strong> programmer, and I have &lt;strong>other skills&lt;/strong>, but I &lt;strong>love coding&lt;/strong> and do it in my free time.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I first heard about &lt;strong>Bitcoin&lt;/strong> while studying. I thought it was cool but didn’t look into it much.&lt;br>
Years later, when I saw that these &lt;strong>coins actually had value&lt;/strong>, I started digging deeper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was fascinated by the &lt;strong>decentralization, censorship resistance, and independence from traditional finance&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
It was obvious—&lt;strong>this is the start of a new paradigm&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What piece of code do you wish you had written?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-piece-of-code-do-you-wish-you-had-written">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-piece-of-code-do-you-wish-you-had-written" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>TensorFlow&lt;/strong> 😀&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What code are you most proud of?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-code-are-you-most-proud-of">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-code-are-you-most-proud-of" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Honestly? &lt;strong>The Bismuth Telegram Bot&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
It may sound silly, but it’s the &lt;strong>first&lt;/strong> project where I really liked how the code was structured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And hey—I even got &lt;strong>paid&lt;/strong> for coding in my free time! YAY! 🎉&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What programming languages have you worked with?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Java&lt;/strong> (for work) – liked it at first.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong> (privately) – loved it. Since then, I never touched any other language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JavaScript &amp;amp; Vue&lt;/strong> – played around briefly, but nothing serious.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What led you to Bismuth?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-led-you-to-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-led-you-to-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I love the &lt;strong>crypto industry&lt;/strong>—it’s hilariously &lt;strong>scammy, overblown, and overvalued&lt;/strong>. But on a serious note, it’s &lt;strong>the future&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
No one can stop it—it will &lt;strong>drag the world with it&lt;/strong>, no matter what anyone tries to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I’m also &lt;strong>obsessed with Python&lt;/strong>, I looked for a &lt;strong>Python-based blockchain&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
I didn’t want just a &lt;strong>Python client&lt;/strong>—I wanted something I could &lt;strong>tear apart and understand&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how I found &lt;strong>Bismuth&lt;/strong>. When I saw the &lt;strong>logo&lt;/strong> and its connection to the &lt;strong>chemical element&lt;/strong>, I was hooked.&lt;br>
I love &lt;strong>fractals&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Bismuth reminds me of that&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First got into &lt;strong>Bitcoin&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then found &lt;strong>Monero (XMR)&lt;/strong>—loved the idea, but disliked &lt;strong>C++&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Got involved with &lt;strong>Monero’s ecosystem&lt;/strong> (created a proposal for a Monero Marketplace Bot – &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4xc98x4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🔗 Proposal&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>With Bismuth, I could finally get into the code&lt;/strong>, which I loved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also &lt;strong>enjoy trading&lt;/strong>—not good at it, but for me, it’s a &lt;strong>game &amp;amp; hobby&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest strength?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>It’s coded in Python.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
That fact alone attracts a lot of &lt;strong>competent developers&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Combined with Bismuth’s &lt;strong>features&lt;/strong>, it’s an &lt;strong>exciting and fun&lt;/strong> project.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest weakness?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-weakness">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-weakness" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>The code itself.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The ideas behind Bismuth are &lt;strong>brilliant&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>HCLivess (Bismuth’s creator) is godlike&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the &lt;strong>code structure needs improvement&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Any thoughts on the current crypto industry?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-any-thoughts-on-the-current-crypto-industry">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-any-thoughts-on-the-current-crypto-industry" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> The next big thing? &lt;strong>Mining isn’t the way forward.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need &lt;strong>nodes that directly validate and store transactions&lt;/strong>, receiving fees &lt;strong>without intermediaries&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
If your blockchain &lt;strong>requires a second layer&lt;/strong>, then your &lt;strong>first layer isn’t the future&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also—&lt;strong>Gossip protocols, WTF.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Most loved programming language, and why?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-loved-programming-language-and-why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-loved-programming-language-and-why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Python! Python! Python!&lt;/strong> 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Most hated programming language, and why?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-hated-programming-language-and-why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-hated-programming-language-and-why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I can’t judge many languages, but between &lt;strong>Python and Java&lt;/strong>—I find Java &lt;strong>boring&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
After &lt;strong>falling in love with Python&lt;/strong>, I &lt;strong>never needed anything else&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What are you up to when you’re not coding?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Playing with my &lt;strong>kids&lt;/strong> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thinking about &lt;strong>obscure stuff&lt;/strong> 🤯&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Gardening&lt;/strong> 🌱&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hanging out with &lt;strong>friends&lt;/strong> 🍻&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Downhill biking&lt;/strong> 🚴 (but no time for it anymore—kids come first!).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I &lt;strong>don’t&lt;/strong> take life &lt;strong>too seriously&lt;/strong> and avoid most &lt;strong>social activities&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Your best piece of programming advice?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
❌ &lt;strong>Don’t read books about programming.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
✅ &lt;strong>Just code.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>

Welcome to the &lt;strong>BisBabble&lt;/strong> series! In this issue, we chat with &lt;strong>Aravind&lt;/strong>, a recent contributor to the Bismuth project.&lt;br>
He shares insights into his background, interests, and development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>📝 The Interview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="-the-interview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#-the-interview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I make sure I taste &lt;strong>all the varieties&lt;/strong> of food being served. 🍽️&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Is programming your day job or a hobby?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> It’s my &lt;strong>day job&lt;/strong>—I work as a &lt;strong>JavaScript Developer&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Code you’re most proud of?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-code-youre-most-proud-of">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-code-youre-most-proud-of" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> My &lt;strong>personal website&lt;/strong> (I guess).&lt;br>
There’s a module that &lt;strong>dynamically generates social media preview images (Open Graph) when the site builds&lt;/strong>—I really like that part.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What programming languages have you worked with?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>C&lt;/strong> – Learned it, but never liked it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong> – Enjoyed using &lt;strong>Django&lt;/strong> to build things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Java&lt;/strong> – My first paid job was in Java, but I wasn’t a fan—maybe because of how I learned it in college.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: You give talks about cutting-edge tech (like Gatsby). Do you see that as part of your job?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-you-give-talks-about-cutting-edge-tech-like-gatsby-do-you-see-that-as-part-of-your-job">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-you-give-talks-about-cutting-edge-tech-like-gatsby-do-you-see-that-as-part-of-your-job" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I love &lt;strong>sharing what I learn&lt;/strong> and helping others on their developer journey. That’s why I &lt;strong>write a blog&lt;/strong>, too—it’s a pleasure!&lt;br>
Also, I feel &lt;strong>noticed in the community&lt;/strong> when I talk about what I’ve learned.&lt;br>
I believe &lt;strong>everyone should share&lt;/strong>, because it’s &lt;strong>beautiful to see different perspectives&lt;/strong>—sometimes they &lt;strong>open new doors&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I’d say I’m a &lt;strong>beginner&lt;/strong> who &lt;strong>understands what a blockchain is&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In college, I heard about a guy &lt;strong>making money trading crypto&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I asked him &lt;strong>what a blockchain was&lt;/strong>—he couldn’t explain it properly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That led me to &lt;strong>do some research&lt;/strong>, but I was still confused.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A year ago, I met someone who &lt;strong>runs a blockchain-based company&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talking to him gave me &lt;strong>clarity&lt;/strong> and motivated me to &lt;strong>learn more&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What led you to Bismuth specifically?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-led-you-to-bismuth-specifically">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-led-you-to-bismuth-specifically" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>All because of Shadowcrypto.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Has the perception of crypto changed for you since that college trader?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-has-the-perception-of-crypto-changed-for-you-since-that-college-trader">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-has-the-perception-of-crypto-changed-for-you-since-that-college-trader" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Absolutely—&lt;strong>a lot has changed&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
For me, &lt;strong>crypto is already influencing the world&lt;/strong>, but it will take time for people around me to &lt;strong>fully adopt it&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
I’ve even read that &lt;strong>my state government is using blockchain (not exactly crypto) for certain projects&lt;/strong>, which is interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What do you like about Bismuth?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-do-you-like-about-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-do-you-like-about-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> The &lt;strong>community&lt;/strong>—you all are so nice! 🤗&lt;br>
Also, Bismuth is &lt;strong>written in Python&lt;/strong>, the only language I understand apart from &lt;strong>JavaScript&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Most loved programming language &amp;amp; why?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-loved-programming-language--why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-loved-programming-language--why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>JavaScript&lt;/strong> (of course).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It started as just a &lt;strong>browser scripting language&lt;/strong>, but after the &lt;strong>V8 engine&lt;/strong>, it became &lt;strong>much more powerful&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Now, you can &lt;strong>write it anywhere&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Webpages&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Servers&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mobile (Ionic, React Native)&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>IoT devices&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Learn once, use everywhere!&lt;/strong> 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Many modern developers rely on libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Laravel). Do you see this as a good thing?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-many-modern-developers-rely-on-libraries-and-frameworks-eg-react-laravel-do-you-see-this-as-a-good-thing">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-many-modern-developers-rely-on-libraries-and-frameworks-eg-react-laravel-do-you-see-this-as-a-good-thing" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>I think it’s a positive evolution&lt;/strong> (though I could be wrong).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frameworks &lt;strong>abstract things developers don’t need to worry about&lt;/strong>, allowing them to &lt;strong>focus on business logic&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
For example, &lt;strong>React&lt;/strong> abstracts &lt;strong>DOM updates&lt;/strong> with its &lt;strong>Virtual DOM&lt;/strong>, making it far better than manually updating the DOM with &lt;strong>JavaScript or jQuery&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What do you do when you’re not coding?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-do-you-do-when-youre-not-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-do-you-do-when-youre-not-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Trekking in the Himalayas&lt;/strong> 🏔️ (most of my vacations this year were for that).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hiking&lt;/strong> 🚶&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Drawing&lt;/strong> 🎨&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Is your off-work routine completely separate from your work, or do you get “aha” moments?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-is-your-off-work-routine-completely-separate-from-your-work-or-do-you-get-aha-moments">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-is-your-off-work-routine-completely-separate-from-your-work-or-do-you-get-aha-moments" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I don’t have a &lt;strong>fixed routine&lt;/strong>, but I &lt;strong>enjoy&lt;/strong> the things I do in my breaks.&lt;br>
Sometimes, I work on an &lt;strong>interesting side project&lt;/strong> (involving code), and that feels like a &lt;strong>good break, too&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
So it’s a &lt;strong>mix and match&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Developers are often stereotyped as geeks, but the best programmers often have creative/artistic sides. Do you agree?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-developers-are-often-stereotyped-as-geeks-but-the-best-programmers-often-have-creativeartistic-sides-do-you-agree">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-developers-are-often-stereotyped-as-geeks-but-the-best-programmers-often-have-creativeartistic-sides-do-you-agree" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Absolutely! I &lt;strong>see code as art&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently started &lt;strong>reading other people’s code&lt;/strong>, and it’s &lt;strong>beautiful&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Creativity isn’t just about &lt;strong>UI or aesthetics&lt;/strong>—it’s also about &lt;strong>how elegantly the code is written&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Your best piece of programming advice?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
💡 &lt;strong>“It’s not rocket science. Someone else wrote it, so if you spend time on it, you’ll understand. Patience!”&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
