### Bismuth: The First Python Blockchain
Bismuth is a modular, efficient, and innovative blockchain protocol built entirely from a fresh Python codebase—unlike most cryptocurrencies that stem from Bitcoin or its derivatives. Inspired by foundational ideas from Satoshi Nakamoto (BitCoin), and other blockchains like Peercoin, NXT and Ethereum, Bismuth reimagines blockchain technology with simplicity, accessibility, and scalability in mind.

### A Unique Approach to Blockchain Technology
Unlike traditional blockchain implementations, Bismuth does not borrow code from existing repositories. Instead, it redefines cryptocurrency logic in a clean and readable way, ensuring seamless cross-platform compatibility, easy business integration, and accessibility for developers of all skill levels—all while minimizing security risks in custom implementations.

### Decentralized, Scalable, and Feature-Rich
Bismuth is a decentralized transaction platform designed for flexibility. It comes with built-in decentralized applications (DApps) and tools that can be used and hosted by anyone. These applications operate as interpretation engines, preventing blockchain bloat and maintaining efficiency.

To optimize performance, Bismuth introduces Hyperblocks, an innovative pruning mechanism inspired by Satoshi’s whitepaper. This feature significantly reduces disk space usage while improving execution speed.

### Privacy & On-Chain Features
Bismuth offers built-in on-chain messaging and data storage, both in public and encrypted forms. With Tor support and optinal privacy enhancing DApps, it delivers robust privacy features for users seeking enhanced security and privacy.

### A Growing Ecosystem
Originally launched as a personal project to explore blockchain technology, Bismuth quickly grew into a feature-rich cryptocurrency and platform, supported by a diverse community of developers, pool operators, exchanges, and blockchain enthusiasts.

The Bismuth Genesis Block was launched on May 1, 2017, marking the beginning of a continuously evolving ecosystem.

### Modular by Design, Scalable by Nature
As both a blockchain protocol and platform, Bismuth introduces a novel approach to database scaling. It supports private contracts, limiting execution to participating users while ensuring public verifiability through alternative mechanisms. With a vast selection of open-source projects, plugin-based scalability, and selective node behavior, Bismuth enables limitless expansion and custom layer development.

Bismuth is more than just a cryptocurrency—it's an adaptable, forward-thinking blockchain designed for real-world applications.
