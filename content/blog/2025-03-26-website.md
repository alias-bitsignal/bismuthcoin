The Bismuth Foundation is proud to introduce our new, community-powered Information Hub.
<!--more-->

### Website

Welcome to [bismuthcoin.org](https://bismuthcoin.org)

### A Sustainable, Forkable Resource
Our top priority was ensuring this new site is not dependent on a single domain. By leveraging **GitHub Pages** and the Hugo static site generator, we give the **Bismuth community** a fully forkable repository.

* If a valuable website goes offline, it is better to have anyone be able to clone or fork the GitHub repo of the site to instantly restore the website on their own domain.

* The site’s main branch automatically generates content in the gh-pages branch, making updates and replication seamless.

### Migrating Valuable Content
Several crucial blog posts previously hosted on `hypernodes.bismuth.live` contain important Bismuth history and technical insights. Because that site is now offline, we’ve imported the most essential posts into our new Hub and will continue adding more. This ensures the community retains access to key information.

### Why bismuthcoin.org?
We chose bismuthcoin.org because the term “coin” immediately signals our project’s cryptocurrency focus—making it memorable, approachable, and inviting for newcomers and blockchain enthusiasts alike.

### Site Highlights
* Docs Section
Features crucial documents and reference materials from the main Bismuth repositories, making it easy to find up-to-date information.

* Blog Section
Gathers important articles and updates, organized by tags. View all tags at:
https://bismuthcoin.org/tags/

### Technical Improvements
* GitHub Pages Hosting
Ensures open collaboration where anyone can contribute, propose changes, or fork the site to keep content alive.

* Hugo Framework + Hextra Theme
Replaces our old WordPress setup with a light, modern static site that’s simpler to maintain and replicate.
