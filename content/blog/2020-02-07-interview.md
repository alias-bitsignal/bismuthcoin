Welcome to another edition of **BisBabble**! In this episode, we chat with **ShadowCrypto**, a dedicated **Bismuth supporter** and key contributor to the **Pawer bot**.

### The Interview  

#### Q: Hello Shadow! We heard about you in a previous BisBabble episode. You are a vibrant supporter of Bismuth and a much-appreciated code contributor to the Pawer bot. Can you tell us a little about yourself?  
**A:** I’m a **programmer by profession** and a **photographer by passion**, drawn to both **shadows and crypto**—hence my username (pun intended).  

---

#### Q: Since forums don’t allow for direct observation, how do you describe yourself at dinner parties?  
**A:** As an **introvert**, I prefer to stay silent and focus on the main purpose—**eating, a lot!**.

---

#### Q: Well, introvert maybe, but you were the one who brought @aravindballa to the party—thanks for that! How did you get into programming in the first place?   
**A:** I have an interesting backstory for this.  

- When I finished school and had to choose a field of study, I told my cousin, **“Anything except computers.”**  
- A couple of years later, I ended up doing my **undergraduate degree in Computer Science**.  

I **never regretted it**—every day was fun!  
I first encountered coding through coursework and was **fascinated** by how **a few lines of code** could perform **complex tasks**.  
That simple realization keeps me **motivated** to this day.  

---

#### Q: The preferred minimalism can be seen in your code. So, programming is your day job?  
**A:** Yes, I **pay my bills** with programming.  

---

#### Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?  
**A:** Like many others—**through Bitcoin**.  

- Initially, I was interested in **crypto as an investment**.  
- At first, **Bitcoin’s technical details were overwhelming**.  
- Over time, I took the time to **understand it better**.  
- I still don’t know **everything in detail**, but I now have a **decent high-level understanding**.  

---

#### Q: What’s the piece of code you’re most proud of?  
**A:**  
Back when I was **new to HTML & CSS**, I worked on **email templates**.  
- I migrated existing templates to **plain HTML & CSS/SASS**.  
- Reduced **1700 lines of code to 450** per template.  
- **Supported all browsers & mail clients.**  
- There were **10 such templates** in total!  

It was a great **learning and implementation experience**.  

---

#### Q: Minimalism again! What programming languages have you worked with?  
- **Python** & **Java** (mostly).  
- **C/C++?** Still unsure if I should count them—I started with them but didn’t continue afterward.  

---

#### Q: What led you to Bismuth?  
**A:** **@cryptotyrion** introduced me to Bismuth.  
The fact that it was **written in Python** (my favorite language) made me **dig deeper**.  

---

#### Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?  
**A:** I’ve been an **investor/trader since 2017**.  

---

#### Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest strength?  
**A:** **The devs.**  

I’m amazed at how **hard and smart they work**, even in the toughest times.  
Also, the **community is incredibly welcoming**.  

Bismuth was my **first open-source contribution**.  
At first, I had **many fears** about where to start, but the **devs made it easy** and were **super helpful**.  
It’s a **perfect learning environment** for blockchain development—especially in **Python**.  

---

#### Q: Thanks! We try to be welcoming because we need contributors like you—and you’ve proved yourself! What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest weakness?  
**A:** **The business model.**  

I may be **wrong or less informed**, but I don’t fully understand how **Bismuth generates money** within its ecosystem.  

---

#### Q: You’ve mainly worked on the Pawer Discord bot. Are there other parts of Bismuth’s ecosystem you’d like to explore?  
**A:** **Absolutely!**  
I’d love to explore:  
- **ZircoDice** 🎲  
- **Dragginator** 🐉  
- Other **DApps** 🚀  

I also want to **build my own DApp**.  
If anyone has **ideas and needs a partner, hit me up!**  

---

#### Q: Most loved programming language & why?  
**A:** **Python**—as simple as **writing a few statements in English**.  

---

#### Q: Most hated programming language & why?  
**A:** I haven’t figured that out yet.  

---

#### Q: You’ll live longer if you only love and don’t hate—good call! On a more personal note, what are you up to when you’re not coding?  
**A:** I’m a **photographer at heart**—that’s what keeps me alive. 📷  

I love finding **patterns, symmetry, and silhouettes** in unexpected places.  
Also, I won a **national-level award** and received a **few other recognitions**—making my parents proud at a young age.  

---

#### Q: Do you see any connections between photography and coding?  
**A:** **Great question!**  

For me, **programming is also an art form**.  

- People express **creativity in different ways**—programming is one of them.  
- Photography and coding **share similarities**—composing a **shot** vs. composing a **function**,  
  keeping things **minimal**, finding **patterns**, and **reusing** them.  

Both give me the **same dopamine hit**—whether I **capture a great photo** or **write a beautiful script**.  

---

#### Q: Your best piece of programming advice?  

💡 **Programming is evolving fast**—it takes just a few days to start learning a language (especially Python).  
💡 **You can automate daily tasks or build fun projects—just for fun!**  
💡 **Not everything you learn has to make money—enjoy programming!**
