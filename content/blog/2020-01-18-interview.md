## 📝 The Interview  

### **Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?**  
**A:** Sure! I’m a **38-year-old software engineer from Germany**, but I’ve only been in the software industry for about **8 years**.  
Before that, I worked as a **retail salesman for an electronics retailer**, but I didn’t enjoy it—so I decided to **study Software Engineering** 🙂.  

As a kid, I was naturally drawn to the **internet** and fascinated by **software**. Unlike everything else that seemed to decay over time, software **stayed the same**—I found that really interesting.  

Today, I work as a **SAP consultant**, helping companies implement **SAP ME (Manufacturing Execution)** to create **paperless plants**. Unfortunately, I no longer code at work, but I still love it and do it privately for fun.

### **Q: How do you describe yourself at dinner parties?**  
**A:** I **don’t**. I prefer to stay in the background and listen to people 😉.  

But if I had to, I’d say I’m **drawn to things outside the mainstream**. Life is too short to be bored by **mediocre stuff**.  
For example, I’ve always been fascinated by **psychoactive drugs, consciousness, and philosophical theories**.  
However, after having **two kids**, responsibility took over—but I’m sure I’m still **strange as hell** 😆.  

That’s what I’d say at a dinner party. And the **one or two people still cool with me after that?** Those are the ones I’d have a beer with.  

---

### **Q: What made you want to start coding?**  
**A:** I love the idea of **creating something from nothing**. Software is especially interesting because of its **unique properties**—once it exists, it can be **used anywhere by anyone**.  

The fact that **someone can write code, publish it on GitHub, and people worldwide can use it** fascinates me.  
I believe **proprietary software will become niche** in the future—so everything I code privately will always be **open source**.  

---

### **Q: Is programming your day job or a hobby?**  
**A:** It was my **day job for a short time**, but now it’s just a **hobby**.  
I’m not the **best** programmer, and I have **other skills**, but I **love coding** and do it in my free time.  

---

### **Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?**  
**A:** I first heard about **Bitcoin** while studying. I thought it was cool but didn’t look into it much.  
Years later, when I saw that these **coins actually had value**, I started digging deeper.  

I was fascinated by the **decentralization, censorship resistance, and independence from traditional finance**.  
It was obvious—**this is the start of a new paradigm**.  

---

### **Q: What piece of code do you wish you had written?**  
**A:** **TensorFlow** 😀

---

### **Q: What code are you most proud of?**  
**A:** Honestly? **The Bismuth Telegram Bot**.  
It may sound silly, but it’s the **first** project where I really liked how the code was structured.  

And hey—I even got **paid** for coding in my free time! YAY! 🎉  

---

### **Q: What programming languages have you worked with?**  
**A:**  
- **Java** (for work) – liked it at first.  
- **Python** (privately) – loved it. Since then, I never touched any other language.  
- **JavaScript & Vue** – played around briefly, but nothing serious.  

---

### **Q: What led you to Bismuth?**  
**A:** I love the **crypto industry**—it’s hilariously **scammy, overblown, and overvalued**. But on a serious note, it’s **the future**.  
No one can stop it—it will **drag the world with it**, no matter what anyone tries to do.  

Since I’m also **obsessed with Python**, I looked for a **Python-based blockchain**.  
I didn’t want just a **Python client**—I wanted something I could **tear apart and understand**.  

That’s how I found **Bismuth**. When I saw the **logo** and its connection to the **chemical element**, I was hooked.  
I love **fractals**, and **Bismuth reminds me of that**.  

---

### **Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?**  
**A:**  
- First got into **Bitcoin**.  
- Then found **Monero (XMR)**—loved the idea, but disliked **C++**.  
- Got involved with **Monero’s ecosystem** (created a proposal for a Monero Marketplace Bot – [🔗 Proposal](https://tinyurl.com/y4xc98x4)).  
- **With Bismuth, I could finally get into the code**, which I loved.  
- I also **enjoy trading**—not good at it, but for me, it’s a **game & hobby**.  

---

### **Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest strength?**  
**A:** **It’s coded in Python.**  
That fact alone attracts a lot of **competent developers**.  
Combined with Bismuth’s **features**, it’s an **exciting and fun** project.  

---

### **Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest weakness?**  
**A:** **The code itself.**  
The ideas behind Bismuth are **brilliant**, and **HCLivess (Bismuth’s creator) is godlike**.  

However, the **code structure needs improvement**.  

---

### **Q: Any thoughts on the current crypto industry?**  
**A:** The next big thing? **Mining isn’t the way forward.**  

We need **nodes that directly validate and store transactions**, receiving fees **without intermediaries**.  
If your blockchain **requires a second layer**, then your **first layer isn’t the future**.  

Also—**Gossip protocols, WTF.**  

---

### **Q: Most loved programming language, and why?**  
**A:** **Python! Python! Python!** 🚀  

---

### **Q: Most hated programming language, and why?**  
**A:** I can’t judge many languages, but between **Python and Java**—I find Java **boring**.  
After **falling in love with Python**, I **never needed anything else**.  

---

### **Q: What are you up to when you’re not coding?**  
**A:**  
- Playing with my **kids** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  
- Thinking about **obscure stuff** 🤯  
- **Gardening** 🌱  
- Hanging out with **friends** 🍻  
- **Downhill biking** 🚴 (but no time for it anymore—kids come first!).  

I **don’t** take life **too seriously** and avoid most **social activities**.  

---

### **Q: Your best piece of programming advice?**  
**A:**  
❌ **Don’t read books about programming.**  
✅ **Just code.**
