The Bismuth Foundation has some fantastic news to share!
<!--more-->

The Bismuth cryptocurrency has been listed on XeggeX, a leading exchange ranked within the top 50 globally at CoinGecko. This is a significant milestone for us and an excellent opportunity for Bismuth’s growth and visibility in the market.

XeggeX has earned a high trust score of 8 on CoinGecko, an achievement to its credibility and reliability in the cryptocurrency community. An important aspect of XeggeX is its transparency, as evidenced by their public disclosure of reserve data. This aligns well with our values of trust and integrity in all our operations.

For those unfamiliar, XeggeX.com operates as a centralized exchange and is renowned for its focus on cryptocurrencies with low to medium market capitalization. A notable feature of XeggeX is its no-KYC (Know Your Customer) requirement, making it accessible and user-friendly.

CoinMarketCap recently added XeggeX as a new exchange, marking its entry into the rankings and signaling growing recognition in the industry. Its position is expected to improve over time, especially since XeggeX supports reserve data, which has not yet been reflected in its current standing.

This listing serves as an important step forward, showcasing the relentless commitment and hard work of our team. It opens new doors for Bismuth and brings us closer to our goal of making digital currency accessible and usable for all.

Let’s celebrate this achievement and continue to push the boundaries of what we can accomplish together!

Continuing our exciting announcement about Bismuth’s listing on XeggeX, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on our journey so far and look ahead to our promising future with XeggeX.

Bismuth has indeed experienced its share of challenges and fluctuations over the years. We all remember the difficulties faced by the community, especially during the prolonged periods of price decline. It’s been a journey of resilience and learning.

In its early days, Bismuth gained significant traction thanks to Cryptopia. This exchange played a crucial role in increasing our trading volume, boosting our price, and enhancing our overall market presence. However, the sudden closure of Cryptopia was a setback for us. Subsequently, qTrade stepped in to list Bismuth. We’re incredibly grateful for the excellent service and technical prowess demonstrated by qTrade during our partnership. Despite their exceptional service, qTrade’s overall market reach and trading volume did not match that of Cryptopia, and eventually, they too ceased operations.

As we continue to celebrate Bismuth’s listing on XeggeX, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges we faced in finding a suitable replacement for qTrade. This search was neither quick nor easy, but it was a journey marked by dedication and community spirit.

We owe a special thanks to a valued member of our community, ‘sgaragagghu’, whose insightful suggestion led us to discover XeggeX. This instance is a powerful testament to the vital role our community plays in our project’s success. It’s a clear demonstration of how collaboration and contributions from each member can significantly impact our collective journey.

This experience has reinforced the importance of our community’s voice and involvement. Your insights, suggestions, and feedback are not just welcomed but are integral to our progress and success. As we embark on this new chapter with XeggeX, let’s remember that our strength lies in our unity and collective effort.

Now, as we partner with XeggeX, we’re entering a new chapter. XeggeX might have a smaller trading volume compared to other top 50 exchanges. — their current 24-hour trading volume stands at ca. $3 Million — but their monthly website user visits are impressively higher than some exchanges with greater trading volumes. This is a promising indicator for Bismuth’s potential growth and visibility.

XeggeX offers a robust platform with established trading services, and we believe this will be a golden opportunity for Bismuth to regain recognition in the cryptocurrency market. We encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with XeggeX — understand their processes for depositing, withdrawing funds, and trading cryptocurrencies. This knowledge will be indispensable as we move forward in this exciting new phase.

Together, we can continue to navigate challenges and seize opportunities, further solidifying Bismuth’s position in the cryptocurrency world.
