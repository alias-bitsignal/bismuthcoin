## 📝 The Interview  

### **Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?**  
**A:** I make sure I taste **all the varieties** of food being served. 🍽️  

---

### **Q: Is programming your day job or a hobby?**  
**A:** It’s my **day job**—I work as a **JavaScript Developer**.  

---

### **Q: Code you’re most proud of?**  
**A:** My **personal website** (I guess).  
There’s a module that **dynamically generates social media preview images (Open Graph) when the site builds**—I really like that part.  

---

### **Q: What programming languages have you worked with?**  
- **C** – Learned it, but never liked it.  
- **Python** – Enjoyed using **Django** to build things.  
- **Java** – My first paid job was in Java, but I wasn’t a fan—maybe because of how I learned it in college.  

---

### **Q: You give talks about cutting-edge tech (like Gatsby). Do you see that as part of your job?**  
**A:** I love **sharing what I learn** and helping others on their developer journey. That’s why I **write a blog**, too—it’s a pleasure!  
Also, I feel **noticed in the community** when I talk about what I’ve learned.  
I believe **everyone should share**, because it’s **beautiful to see different perspectives**—sometimes they **open new doors**.  

---

### **Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?**  
**A:** I’d say I’m a **beginner** who **understands what a blockchain is**.  

---

### **Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?**  
**A:**  
- In college, I heard about a guy **making money trading crypto**.  
- I asked him **what a blockchain was**—he couldn’t explain it properly.  
- That led me to **do some research**, but I was still confused.  
- A year ago, I met someone who **runs a blockchain-based company**.  
- Talking to him gave me **clarity** and motivated me to **learn more**.  

---

### **Q: What led you to Bismuth specifically?**  
**A:** **All because of Shadowcrypto.**  

---

### **Q: Has the perception of crypto changed for you since that college trader?**  
**A:** Absolutely—**a lot has changed**.  
For me, **crypto is already influencing the world**, but it will take time for people around me to **fully adopt it**.  
I’ve even read that **my state government is using blockchain (not exactly crypto) for certain projects**, which is interesting!  

---

### **Q: What do you like about Bismuth?**  
**A:** The **community**—you all are so nice! 🤗  
Also, Bismuth is **written in Python**, the only language I understand apart from **JavaScript**.  

---

### **Q: Most loved programming language & why?**  
**A:** **JavaScript** (of course).  

It started as just a **browser scripting language**, but after the **V8 engine**, it became **much more powerful**.  
Now, you can **write it anywhere**:  
- **Webpages**  
- **Servers**  
- **Mobile (Ionic, React Native)**  
- **IoT devices**  

**Learn once, use everywhere!** 🚀  

---

### **Q: Many modern developers rely on libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Laravel). Do you see this as a good thing?**  
**A:** **I think it’s a positive evolution** (though I could be wrong).  

Frameworks **abstract things developers don’t need to worry about**, allowing them to **focus on business logic**.  
For example, **React** abstracts **DOM updates** with its **Virtual DOM**, making it far better than manually updating the DOM with **JavaScript or jQuery**.  

---

### **Q: What do you do when you’re not coding?**  
**A:**  
- **Trekking in the Himalayas** 🏔️ (most of my vacations this year were for that).  
- **Hiking** 🚶  
- **Drawing** 🎨  

---

### **Q: Is your off-work routine completely separate from your work, or do you get “aha” moments?**  
**A:** I don’t have a **fixed routine**, but I **enjoy** the things I do in my breaks.  
Sometimes, I work on an **interesting side project** (involving code), and that feels like a **good break, too**.  
So it’s a **mix and match**.  

---

### **Q: Developers are often stereotyped as geeks, but the best programmers often have creative/artistic sides. Do you agree?**  
**A:** Absolutely! I **see code as art**.  

I recently started **reading other people’s code**, and it’s **beautiful**.  
Creativity isn’t just about **UI or aesthetics**—it’s also about **how elegantly the code is written**.  

---

### **Q: Your best piece of programming advice?**  
**A:**  
💡 **“It’s not rocket science. Someone else wrote it, so if you spend time on it, you’ll understand. Patience!”**  

---

🙏 **Thanks a lot, Aravind, for answering our questions! We can’t wait to see your next contributions to Bismuth!** 🚀
