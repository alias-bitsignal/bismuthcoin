## How to Run a Mainnet Node

This guide provides several methods to set up and run a Mainnet Node. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

### Automatic Installation
For a quick setup, use our [Auto Install Script](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/blob/master/Hypernodes/00-Auto-Install-Script.md), which also installs the sidechain Hypernode.

### Manual Installation
Prefer a hands-on approach? Follow our [Manual Installation Guide](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/blob/master/Install/Linux.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Docker Deployment
Deploy a containerized node easily with our [Bismuth Docker Image](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-Docker/tree/master/node).

### Database Snapshots
- **Download Snapshot:** Use the [Snapshot Guideline](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/blob/master/Snapshot/Ledger_Mainnet.md) to obtain an existing database snapshot.
- **Create Snapshot:** Generate a backup with the [Bismuth Snapshot Script](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/util/blob/master/snapshot_create.py).
