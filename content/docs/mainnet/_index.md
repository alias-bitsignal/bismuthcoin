## Bismuth Mainnet Info


* Bismuth is the only project in the world that has implemented the alternative approach to smart contracts as suggested by Nick Szabo.
* Thanks to the down-to-earth implementation of contracts, Bismuth does not require a separate oracle system. Every node is an oracle by default.
* Bismuth is the only project in the world that supports multiple cryptosystems for signatures, making it effectively resistant to quantum attack towards any single system.
* Bismuth blockchain pruning exists since 2017 and reduces blockchain size to 100 MB at any given point.
* Bismuth is the first blockchain platform fully created in Python.
* There is a unique system at the core of Bismuth mining, it utilizes bit matching for block hash linking.
* Bismuth now has many core developers, most of them are pool owners. PoW works for adoption.
* Bismuth mainnet launched in 2017, but has been in development since 2014. The transaction, network, consensus layers, the wallet, the original explorer and several dapps have all been written by a single person.
* The main problem of Ethereum is ignoring that transactions that do not involve value transfers do not need consequential order / Nakamoto consensus. ETH scaling is therefore limited to it’s serialization design. Bismuth is not.
* Bismuth contracts are independent of the core layer. Nothing on Bismuth interferes with the consensus layer.
* Bismuth plugins enable you to create applications that do not rely on blockchain speed (off-chain) but can still fully utilize all advantages of it.
* Hypernodes run on their own PoS system.
* Bismuth rewards drop with every single block.
* Bismuth is the only cryptocurrency project in the world that supports multiple address formats (ECDSA, RSA,…)
* Bismuth’s casino Zircodice was created after failed promises of the XVC developer “John Connor” mysteriously disappeared and abandoned the project.
* Bismuth has an automated giveaway bot for Twitter which rewards users for tweeting about it.
* Python is the most attractive and effective language of them all.
* Bismuth combines voluntarism with decentralization to secure unlimited scaling. It works because users are given a choice, not being dictated which plugin, dapp or crystal to use. Consistency is required only on the most elemental level.
* Bismuth allows for on-chain forking on the secondary level without any impact on it.
* One of the ultimate goals of Bismuth is to become the blockchain enabler. Not to force anything on users or their nodes to limit scalability, but to let them use the parts of the ecosystem which they opt for. To create an elemental mosaic. Total decentralization.
* With Ethereum, every computer is a copy of other computers. With Bismuth, every computer is an independent server with optional integrations.
