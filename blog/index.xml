Total number of Hypernodes, both active and inactive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plot below shows the total Hypernode collateral, both active and inactive. As can be seen, the total amount of collateral is 9,320,000. The total amount of BIS in circulation is 37,06 million. Hence, the amount of active collateral accounts for 9.2 % of the total supply, or 25.1 % if the amount of inactive collateral is included.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2023-11-15/header.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Here is the Tornado Bismuth Wallet Startup Guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Overview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="overview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#overview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Issue:&lt;/strong> The Tornado Bismuth Wallet fails to start because it needs an updated server list, but the default API is inaccessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong> Manually specify a server IP and port from a &lt;strong>backup API URL&lt;/strong> that’s synchronized to the latest block height.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Windows OS Hotfix&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="windows-os-hotfix">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#windows-os-hotfix" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h4>1. Get a Valid IP and Port:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="1-get-a-valid-ip-and-port">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#1-get-a-valid-ip-and-port" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go to the backup API URL:
&lt;a href="https://bismuth.world/api/legacy.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bismuth.world/api/legacy.json&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose an IP address and port listed at the latest (highest) block height.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4>2. Create a Batch File:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="2-create-a-batch-file">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#2-create-a-batch-file" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create a text file named &lt;code>tornado.txt&lt;/code> and then rename it to &lt;code>tornado.bat&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4>3. Add Launch Commands:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="3-add-launch-commands">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#3-add-launch-commands" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the Tornado Wallet and your batch file are on the same drive, use:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">

&lt;a href="#add-liquidity" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Once you have wBIS on BSC, you can provide liquidity by binding both $wBIS and $BNB to a liquidity pool. &lt;a href="https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/add/BNB/0x56672ecb506301b1E32ED28552797037c54D36A9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wBIS/BSC Pool&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more volume in the pool, the less the volatility and the more it can be noticed by BNB traders. Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the liquidity pool to support Bismuth. If you’re new to BNB and Pancakeswap, make sure you read about impermanent loss so you know what you’re doing and what the potential risks are.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2>The wBIS Token&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-wbis-token">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-wbis-token" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>wBIS is an ERC-20 ETH Token with 1:1 native BIS counterpart.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;p>The Eth bridge crystal comes with a one-click button to set up the correct custom token on your metamask extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bridge is decentralized and runs thanks to a custom BIS protocol.
It relies on Both a bridge and an oracle.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>BIS Bridge Address: &lt;code>Bis1UBRiDGEQc9mBywXpwFZX6LF7hN4i8Qy9m&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://bismuth.im/search?quicksearch=Bis1UBRiDGEQc9mBywXpwFZX6LF7hN4i8Qy9m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bridge explorer link&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2>Add liquidity&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="add-liquidity">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#add-liquidity" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once you have wBIS on ETH, you can provide liquidity by binding both $wBIS and $ETH to a liquidity pool. &lt;a href="https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xf4f82f8d84c529987201609cecee8ab136a50c8c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wBIS/ETH Pool&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more volume in the pool, the less the volatility and the more it can be noticed by ETH traders. Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the liquidity pool to support Bismuth. If you’re new to ETH and Uniswap, make sure you read about impermanent loss so you know what you’re doing and what the potential risks are.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Farm wBIS on Unicrypt&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="farm-wbis-on-unicrypt">&lt;/span>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-02-24-bis-2.0.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Late last year, the Bismuth Foundation unveiled “Bismuth2.0”. The reveal was brief, did not go into any detail and the team remained silent on the topic for the following months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would like to thank everyone for their patience, the time has finally come for the big reveal! Let’s get right into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>The Basics&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-basics">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-basics" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>A Refreshed Look&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="a-refreshed-look">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#a-refreshed-look" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>As some may have noticed, Bismuth partially “stealth rebranded” in late 2020 shortly after the Bismuth2.0 unveil. It was necessary to have a logo that was professional, but paid respect to the legacy artwork-themed logo for continuity. The new logo retains the same abstract and color scheme of the previous logo, while being much more minimalist and modern. Going into the Bismuth2.0 launch, this will be adopted as the official logo.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Bismuth2.0 Core&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="bismuth20-core">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#bismuth20-core" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Bismuth originated as a single-file code base. It grew to become a powerful engine after many thousands of updates &amp;amp; code iterations. With Bismuth2.0, it was time to consolidate, organize and clean up to get better control of the code, permit easier maintenance and streamline external work on the code. Regardless of the core overhaul, the new V2 code base will retain full compatibility with legacy nodes. Legacy support may be dropped at one point in the future once Bismuth2.0 has fully transitioned. Below is a summary of the core overhaul.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Core code consolidated, organized and cleaned.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved documentation for code, structures and custom architecture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved functional isolation with help of core modules.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easier to test with both unit tests on core modules as well as end-to-end test using the local regmode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amounts are now stored under integer format instead of decimals, which allows for a smaller ledger, faster balance queries and no more complex rounding handling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Signatures and public keys are stored as binary instead of hex; meaning that less database space is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Startup sequence fully reworked with “solo mode” on initiation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More sanity checks at startup.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reorganization and refactoring of code under logical units.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The move to V2 core spreads across a whopping 246 commits, 142 changed files, 12,142 additions and 4,917 deletions.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Easier on-boarding&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="easier-on-boarding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#easier-on-boarding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The Bismuth mobile wallet – more on that below – and growing support for native Bismuth tokens makes it way easier for everyone to use Bismuth and its little known features.
As a result, it is also easier to build upon Bismuth, with more and more infrastructure and tools exposing undervalued use cases based upon native tokens or more evolved second layer protocols Bismuth supports thanks to its unique design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sticking with early goals, we aim to make Bismuth the platform of choice when it comes to learn, play, research and build practical applications with core blockchain concepts and Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Marketing and communication&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="marketing-and-communication">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#marketing-and-communication" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Until then, we had hoped the technical documentation, code samples, proof of concept distributed apps (dApps) and monthly progress reports would provide enough matter for other developers and users to fully grasp what we were building, then translate that into more end user oriented content for anyone to understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This seems to be over-optimistic so the team will, in the future, provide more end-user oriented and practical short content to clearly convey the specifics of Bismuth and the powerful framework it has become. Existing, working, but under-the-radar apps and use cases will also be given some well deserved light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The recent months also saw the emergence of several valuable contributions ranging from third party developers to just users learning.
This proved how easy Bismuth is to work with. These contributions have been rewarded by the developers fund.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In order to trigger further similar contributions, more rewards are planned and a list of potential bounties with detailed specifications will be released over the next months.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Decentralized Finance&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="decentralized-finance">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#decentralized-finance" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Decentralized Finance – “DeFi” – has been on the tip of everyone’s tongue over the past year. With a skyrocketing population of individuals growing tired of the world’s financial institutions, the democratization of finance is at its infancy- and the crypto industry is its nurturer. There have been many projects that have already taken the first steps in this space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>With Bismuth2.0, DeFi functionality built on top of Bismuth becomes a reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Atomic Swaps&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="atomic-swaps">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#atomic-swaps" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Bismuth was a project written from scratch, and unfortunately was not born with the bells and whistles derived from forked protocols. One of such things is the atomic swap- which is a functionality that enables cross-chain swaps. This particular feature allows an individual to trade a coin from one chain against a coin on a different chain in an almost trustless manner. Bismuth had no simple mechanism to achieve this functionality- until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A timelock mechanism – a crucial component for atomic swaps – is in the design phase, and will be tested and released once the V2 network is stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>With this functionality, cross-chain atomic swaps become a reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The atomic swap feature can then also be used with Bismuth sidechains – see below – to further glue the main PoW chain and its derived PoS chains.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Contracts and Scripts&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="contracts-and-scripts">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#contracts-and-scripts" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One strength of Bismuth is its execution model and no need for a virtual machine (VM) in core nodes. Another under-looked feature is Bismuth native support for three different cryptographic schemes: RSA (with large key size) , ECDSA (like BTC or ETH) and the more modern ED25519. In addition to interesting cross-chain potential features, this also opens the door to all the core crypto gimmicks any of these schemes do support like scriptless scripts. Multisigs and threshold signatures for instance are natively supported with no need for any more processing in the node.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Call for projects will be issued to make this usable in practice.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Wrapped Tokens&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="wrapped-tokens">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#wrapped-tokens" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Bismuth is not new to wrapped tokens. Very early in its history, it was available to trade on HEAT, one of the first DEXs. This was done thanks to a gateway wrapping native $BIS. Later came VITE and its ViteX exchange which listed BIS and there as well, $BIS is wrapped on another chain via a custom gateway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ERC20: Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges have recently surged in popularity, with notable platforms such as Uniswap overtaking major CEXs over the past months. With billions of dollars in on-the-table liquidity, wrapped solutions have been created for currencies built on protocols separate from Ethereum. Currencies such as Bitcoin have had wrappers created (eg; RenBTC, wBTC) to help facilitate trade on ETH-based DEXs.
A first proof of concept of BIS &amp;lt;&amp;gt; wBIS bridge was run for a limited time by a third party.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Bismuth Foundation will create and support an official ERC20 Bismuth wrapper to tap into the enormous and growing liquidity available on Uniswap and other Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges.&lt;/strong>
This will also help Bismuth potentially gain exposure from the tens of thousands of speculators that utilize DEXs on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Oracles&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="oracles">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#oracles" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Oracles are a tool that permit dApps and smart contracts to access off-chain data. In all circumstances, blockchains are isolated and have a very limited exposure to off-chain data. For more complex applications, it is crucial to access data points that would traditionally not be available on-chain; such as pricing data aggregated from an exchange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ongoing research and specifications- such as EggPool’s “Link Of Trust” will allow Bismuth to support Oracles in a very novel manner, making use of the “Freedom of Interpretation” concept. In addition to Oracles, Link of Trust also addresses concerns such as pseudonymous digital identity, reputation, and pseudo uniqueness. More information on Bismuth Oracles will be published once V2 is stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Decentralized Exchange&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="decentralized-exchange">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#decentralized-exchange" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The ERC20 Bismuth wrapper will allow Bismuth to be traded on existing ETH-based DEXs, however with improvements to the plugins protocol, second-layer solutions, and a specific sidechain, Bismuth could also operate its own decentralized exchange with rapid blocktimes, support several blockchains through Bismuth Tokens (bBTC, bETH), and facilitate trade through native liquidity pools or bonding curves.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Sidechains&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="sidechains">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#sidechains" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Sidechains are an extremely novel utility in which network layers can work in tandem but are not limited by one another. A sidechain has existed on Bismuth since 2019, known as the Hypernode Network. This first born sidechain acts as the PoS layer for the Bismuth protocol – embedding network metrics within transactions, which in result are used to compute the weekly Hypernodes rewards. The current Hypernode implementation is in need for pruning as well, which is planned later into the Bismuth2.0 release. As well as a lighter footprint on hardware, the next iteration of Hypernodes will feature further stability, less disk space usage, and far less resource usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>As the Bismuth team envisions them, side chains are the definitive answer to scalability, because they allow application level sharding.&lt;/strong>
As you can see what’s happening with ETH, the most prominent use case of a chain becomes so prevalent it either leads to congestion or insane fees. As a result, lesser valuated apps can no longer be used because the fees are then higher than the provided service’s perceived value. This effectively kills any other dApp running on the platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a Bismuth side chain, every application or class of application can run on its own side chain. Loosely coupled to the main PoW chain, and totally independent of the other side chains. Every side chain can have its own transaction format, its own block times, pruning limit and parameters, its own use case and fees structure – if any.
Every chain runs independently, no matter the potential congestion of its cousin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the topic of sidechains, the possibilities are limitless when it comes to parallel utilities built on top of the Bismuth protocol. &lt;strong>Sidechains permit Bismuth to be virtually infinitely scalable&lt;/strong>, with the sole limiting factor being available compute resources. Individuals and enterprises alike can build on top of Bismuth while being unbound by the existing constraints of the Bismuth PoW chain through the use of sidechains. The Bismuth Foundation has planned the following sidechains to be constructed on top of the Bismuth protocol:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Data archiving side chain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IOT &amp;amp; MQTT sidechain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dedicated FT/NFT sidechain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Metadata storage sidechain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>More sidechains are also envisioned:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dedicated DEX sidechain, with rapid execution, fast block intervals, and data pruning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dedicated Oracles sidechain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Side chains are an essential ingredient to the future Bismuth platform growth. They bring the flexibility to build blockchain powered applications with little effort, capitalizing on Bismuth’s experience, existing infrastructure, and toolset.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Platform Expansion&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="platform-expansion">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#platform-expansion" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Bismuth is a from-scratch Python protocol that did not fork code from existing protocols. Therefore when it comes to having mobile and hardware applications, those would have to be built from the ground up to facilitate Bismuth’s architecture. For the Bismuth2.0 release, we have some exciting news in this area.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Mobile Applications&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="mobile-applications">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#mobile-applications" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There used to be a mobile wallet for Bismuth, developed by Chainzilla- known as the Chameleon wallet. Unfortunately, support was dropped by the original developers and no longer was a viable option. A brand new, open-source and custom built mobile wallet is now available. &lt;strong>This wallet is “one-click” install on Android and coming to iOS, which is huge in regards to on-boarding non-tech savvy individuals&lt;/strong>. You can refer to the related article there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bismuth mobile wallet has integrated support for native tokens, and is dApp ready: it comes with BisUrl support – a way to convey all data about a transaction into a reliable format, as well as “operation” and “data” support, making the mobile wallet an universal tool to interact with any second layer protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Hardware Devices&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="hardware-devices">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#hardware-devices" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A third-party development team is currently working on a hardware wallet device. The design of this wallet addresses most of the issues other hardware wallets face, including price, privacy and plausible deniability.
This device will support signing of BIS transactions but also paves the way to more use cases, like sign-in and secure off-chain authentication.
&lt;strong>We are extremely pleased to announce that this will be cheap, open-source, and based on largely available hardware and Python code&lt;/strong>. Integration with Ledger devices is also in the research stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Closing Thoughts&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="closing-thoughts">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#closing-thoughts" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Bismuth has been in constant, non-stop development by the Bismuth Foundation – a team of dedicated individuals that have gone above and beyond the call of duty to maintain and upgrade Bismuth until this day. This effort has never wavered – the team is as active as ever, with huge things happening behind the scenes. Bismuth’s custom code base and architecture means that adoption and integration is not as immediate as most tokens and forks. However this in a way is not an obstacle – &lt;strong>Bismuth does not have the limitations of most cryptocurrencies that are constructed on existing architecture fathered by Bitcoin or Ethereum&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Progress is being made- and with great speed. Until recently Bismuth native tokens were a little known feature of the legacy wallet, with little documentation nor use. Only just recently have we seen massive changes in this area:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Full token support on the browser-based Tornado wallet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dedicated tokens explorer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tokens support on Discord, via the Discord Pawer bot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mobile wallet, with full tokens and generic protocol support.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Native Bismuth tokens are now as easy to use as the core Bismuth coin, and usage can now be much more widespread for end-user cases. &lt;strong>Much more use-cases for tokens will come to life over the coming months&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unaffected by the ever changing hype and meaningless trends that come and go, the Bismuth team kept its focus on strengthening the core and basic building blocks of a wide ecosystem, with real and practical use cases as the end goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have had applications built on top of Bismuth, such as the Bismuth Tesla EV battery life dApp, and Phone battery monitor. With Elon Musk’s recent and loud entry into the crypto industry, we are hoping to capitalize on the momentum and help give these tech-oriented dApps some much-needed exposure. The use-cases are limitless when it comes to utilitarian development on top of Bismuth. This is further compounded by the fact that all code can be written in the world’s most popular and fastest growing programming language, Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A global overview of the Bismuth 2.0 Roadmap will be released in the next weeks and will be followed by detailed insights of the various sections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The crypto industry is moving at a rapid pace, and the upcoming 2.0 launch will enable Bismuth to capitalize on this. It is now easier for the core development team to add new functions and features on a stable codebase, extend the building blocks and support practical, real world use-cases&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would like to thank the loyal Bismuth community for their support over the years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-03-24/state-machines.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Are you familiar with Finite state machines? They are everywhere, yet, we don’t see them as such.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>State machines&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="state-machines">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#state-machines" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A state machine – in mathematical terms – is a model of computation.
It is defined by a – finite – list of states, including an initial state as well as transitions: conditions that have it move from one state to another one.
This seems very simple, and it can be. Here is a sample machine from Wikipedia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-03-24/finite_state_machine.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple state machine: a door that can only be closed or open.
Don’t be fooled by the apparent simplicity of this sample: state machine can be very, very complex… but also very useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Here’s why:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="heres-why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#heres-why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>The most known computation model is the Turing machine. Most computer hardware and programming languages rely on this model.
This is a very open model, that allows to do many things. This is also a weakness, because you can’t always predict what states such a model will end up in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has several implications. With classical programming, you can end up with an edge case where your program will run forever – be it because of the algorithm, or an implementation bug – or end up in an unplanned state, where it will be stuck and never recover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of the flaws of the ETH VM for instance, which is Turing complete. Its capacity to run loops means it can be stuck inside a large or infinite loop and consume a huge amount of gas.
Other smart contract languages willingly chose to have a non Turing complete language to avoid unexpected side effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same happens with complex virtual objects like a client or server for a given protocol. Say, a custom protocol over a raw socket, or at a higher level, a blockchain node.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When designing such an object, interacting with others, you often – consciously or not – think of it as a state machine. The node is “starting”, it’s “syncing” or “digesting a transaction” or “waiting for next block” aso…
When you implement this with “regular” code, events, functions, methods, private or global variables… you are not bound by a state machine computation model. You are Turing complete.
The compiler lets you write dangerous things you are not aware of, that can backfire: your system can end up in a totally unstable and unplanned state, with no way back to a functioning mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The limits of the state machine model then become a strength: If you model your object as a state machine and take care of all the needed states and transitions, you are sure (to the extend of your trust in the state machine framework you use) your system is only in one of the planned states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could end up stuck in a given state with no way out, because you forgot a transition, but it will never magically jump from one state to another with no reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working with state machine is then more stringent: you have to define all possible states and conditions, instead of just the obvious paths. But these added constraints also force you to fully define your model, and allow to reason on a global scale, with an overview you can rely on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>State machines and Python&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="state-machines-and-python">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#state-machines-and-python" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Any Turing complete language can implement state machines, since state machines are a subset of the Turing model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can code state machine behavior with vanilla code. Have a class, with a private member representing state, and methods as transitions for instance. This is enough for simple things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to go further, nice libraries and tools have been coded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for Python, I picked two of them:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Pytransition&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="pytransition">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#pytransition" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Pytransition is an actively maintained and very complete state machine framework, with several extensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The github comes with a full documentation, the quickstart being a funny “narcoleptic super hero” example&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-03-24/state-machine-02.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quickstart from Pytransitions
Note the diagram is generated from a “diagram” extension, by the module itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is even more since a GUI, running with a Tornado web server and JS client code, allows to draw and manipulate the models. It’s not only fun but pretty useful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-03-24/state-machine-03.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>State machine GUI editor&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many examples come with the library. Best thing you can do is bookmark the Github and use it for your next project or rewrite, then come and tell us! &lt;a href="https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Pysm&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="pysm">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#pysm" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This library is older and simpler, and it’s also why it was selected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another big up is its MicroPython support. With embedded python coming everywhere, it would be a shame not begin able to use that state pattern there as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, Pysm is a complete library, with all you’ll need including transition callbacks, and state hooks, conditional transitions… while remaining lightweight and fast.
It comes with documentation, test and examples. &lt;a href="https://github.com/pgularski/pysm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-03-24/state-machine-04.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a sample of a complex hierarchical state machine designed with Pysm
(taken from pysm github)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>When to use state machines?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="when-to-use-state-machines">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#when-to-use-state-machines" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Some use cases are obvious: when the logic is that of an “automaton”, like a vending machine, a “stubborn” and predictable machine that does only a handful of things in the right order, it’s quite easy.
In that case, state machine should be a no brainer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some cases are more difficult to grasp at first sight, but they may be where you have the most to gain. Take a socket reading for example, with some custom protocol, or a parser for a specific syntax.
Here, consider the logic as a state machine can alleviate the code a lot, make it clearer, and easier to explain. Added bonus: you’re more confident you did not forgot edge cases (unit test still are required, don’t get me wrong)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last case is for more complex systems, like a whole blockchain node for instance. As simple as it looks, it’s not at all, and converting legacy code to a state machine can be a huge work. This could even force you to rethink your protocol…
One thing is sure: the sooner you consider your system as a state machine, the better you’ll have a practical overview you can spec, discuss, and work with.&lt;/p>

We’re always happy to see new users jump in on the Bismuth Discord and ask questions.
More over dev questions…
And above all, we like it when these users then come back with a “Oh, by the way, I just did that small thing…”&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The Hypernodes Map&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-hypernodes-map">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-hypernodes-map" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Here is what “Dingo” did: &lt;a href="https://bismuth-map.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bismuth-map.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
And best of all is Dingo released the application as &lt;a href="https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open-Source&lt;/a> for anyone to run the the Bismuth Map.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-02-21-bismuth_map-02.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="#timeline" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>After Dingo announced his map, a tweet was sent out by a team member:&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="#reading-between-the-lines" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One nice thing this map also shows is that while keeping an eye on the current trends and newest promising technology, Bismuth continues to grow its fundamentals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have look at the upper left corner, with the core financial Hypernodes metrics in a snap:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yes, the Bismuth Hypernodes still pay more than 17% yearly. Not for 1 month before vanishing, but every single week since they’re up, more than 16 months ago. This is sustainable, this is an in-deniable proof users keep faith in the project.
More than 7 million BIS staked. More than 26% of the total supply. More than $820,000 locked. Awesome is it not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Low cap, yes.
Low profile, certainly.
No future? Great Scott! Far from it 😀&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-01-15/mobile-wallet.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
For way too long, Bismuth had no proper mobile wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One historical reason is that – despite being the fastest growing language – Python on mobile still is not mainstream. Sure, you can run a fully functional Tornado wallet on Android, but that’s not a 2 click install.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s certainly not an excuse however and the team saw the need for an easy to install and operate mobile wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The chameleon episode&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-chameleon-episode">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-chameleon-episode" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Then, we paid an external team to integrate Bismuth as part of a multi-currency wallet. April 2019, Bismuth was available on the Chameleon wallet. A closed source multi currency wallet from Chainzilla.
There was two benefits for Bismuth:
– Instantly working wallet, from experienced team. No wasted time, no debug or support.
– Chameleon user base. We certainly gained some exposure being present on that wallet, and our potential user base grew immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alas, late 2020 Chainzilla announced they were stopping the wallet and would open source it. Despite numerous emails and tweets, to day the code is not available yet, and we got no answer from Chainzilla about the custom derivation scheme they used at start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were then in a worse position than ever… No more wallet, plus users stuck with a seed they couldn’t use anymore!
Later on, we were able to recover one of the two derivation scheme, the older one still is missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Behind the scenes work&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="behind-the-scenes-work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#behind-the-scenes-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In the mean time, there was several aborted attempts to code our own wallet. This did not went through for lack of in house competences and time, but we had a few constraints in mind anyway, mainly with maintenance in mind:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use a known and future proof language and framework&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aim for minimalist features first&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ability to publish the wallet on app stores&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross platform&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Single code base if possible across platforms&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As close to native as possible&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We did some PWA – Progressive Web Apps experiments, looked at svelte.js, electron, and saw more and more mentions of Dart and Flutter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Flutter looked like a really great candidate, fulfilling all of our criterion.
We began to search for Flutter experimented developers, and that’s when RedDwarf enters 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RedDwarf had some experience with a previous crypto mobile app with flutter, and was happy to offer his help. He ended up doing way more than that, since he fully developed the current “my Bismuth Wallet” app.
The code is based upon Natrium Flutter wallet and is fully open source.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>End result and reward&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="end-result-and-reward">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#end-result-and-reward" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>If we aimed for a minimalist app to start with, RedDwarf worked faster than we could test and we finally have a full featured wallet that also includes tokens management for instance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team was very pleased to work with him and the end result really is impressive.
The Bismuth team happily awards a 20,000 BIS reward to RedDwarf and offers him free HN hosting if he needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wallet is available on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?src=AppAgg.com&amp;amp;id=io.reddwarf.my_bismuth_wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Android&lt;/a> and the source code at &lt;a href="https://github.com/redDwarf03/my_bismuth_wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>iOS Version&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="ios-version">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#ios-version" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>iOS Version is already working, thanks to Flutter and Dart, but Apple decided otherwise.
Very recent policies change at Apple store made it so Crypto related app (namely, wallets) are subject to pretty restrictive conditions to be released. As a result the iOS version is not publicly available for the time being, but the team is working on a solution. We expect good news in the next weeks or months.&lt;/p>

Months ago, Bismuth user “Whatever” developed a shiny app to monitor his BIS mining rigs, wallets and Hypernodes.
Apps you code for yourself, because you feel an urging need for it can end up most useful, and this one makes no exception.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2021-01-01-toolbox-01.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Preview of the Bismuth toolbox main screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a followup, Whatever also added more useful intel with hypernodes related data and monitoring
The Hypernode monitoring section
This app was already showcased in previous progress report:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>June 15, 2020 progress report&lt;/li>
&lt;li>September 2020, progress report&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>Interview with Whatever&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="interview-with-whatever">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#interview-with-whatever" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Very nice work and a much-needed app! So, we had to get in touch and ask him a few questions. 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Getting to Know You&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="getting-to-know-you">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#getting-to-know-you" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I’m an elder guy (&amp;gt;25 y.o.) with a young soul (~25 y.o.), working a 9-to-5 job and enjoying hobbies like programming and cryptocurrencies.&lt;br>
My job isn’t in IT, and I’m not a professional coder—just an enthusiast. However, I do use programming at work (mainly MATLAB) for data modeling and process automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> When did you first encounter computers and coding?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I got my first PC in college—an Intel Celeron 100MHz, as I recall.&lt;br>
My programming journey started with Pascal and Basic (if you don’t know these, consider yourself lucky 😆).&lt;br>
Sadly, my career path didn’t require coding, so it remained a hobby.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Introduction to Blockchain &amp;amp; Bismuth&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="introduction-to-blockchain--bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#introduction-to-blockchain--bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> How did you first get introduced to blockchain?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> It was early 2017, just before the global crypto hype. ETH was around $10 at the time.&lt;br>
I asked myself, &lt;em>“WTF is this Bitcoin everyone is talking about?”&lt;/em> and started reading about blockchains, BTC, ETH, and mining.&lt;br>
It all seemed &lt;strong>new and complicated&lt;/strong>—which made me dive in.&lt;br>
I had some cash to burn, so I built my first GPU mining rig and started mining ETH. Later, I discovered BIS in late 2018.&lt;br>
BIS was different—it wasn’t just “another shitcoin to mine.” I actually took the time to understand the project.&lt;br>
What kept me around was the &lt;strong>friendly and supportive community&lt;/strong> (shoutout to EggdraSyl, Evilpokerqueen, Raetch, and others).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Tech &amp;amp; Development&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="tech--development">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#tech--development" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Is there a piece of code you wish you had written?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I wish I had written Microsoft Windows—or, at the very least, I wish they would stop developing it (they have no idea what they’re doing 😆).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Any code you’re particularly proud of?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> None, honestly. I’m not a professional coder, and I’ve never been formally trained.&lt;br>
If anything, I’m ashamed of most of my code.&lt;br>
However, I’m proud of the &lt;strong>scientific solutions&lt;/strong> I’ve achieved using my ugly code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Strengths &amp;amp; Weaknesses of Bismuth&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="strengths--weaknesses-of-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#strengths--weaknesses-of-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> What do you think is Bismuth’s biggest strength?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> A &lt;strong>talented dev team&lt;/strong> and an &lt;strong>engaged, supportive community&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> And its biggest weakness?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Lack of marketing.&lt;/strong> It’s a result of limited resources—there aren’t enough people with the right expertise in the team or community.&lt;br>
A great product isn’t enough; it needs to be &lt;strong>marketed&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
The dev team has done excellent work, but now it’s time to &lt;strong>sell it&lt;/strong>. BIS has strong features that should be showcased.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>The time has come to sketch out a real marketing campaign.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Programming Preferences&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="programming-preferences">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#programming-preferences" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Your most loved programming language, and why?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Hard to pick just one. If I had to choose two:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong> (for general-purpose coding)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>MATLAB&lt;/strong> (for scientific computing)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I’ve only written a handful of lines in Python, but I love its simplicity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Most hated programming language, and why?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Java.&lt;/strong> I do a lot of Android development in Java, and I hate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Too much &lt;strong>boilerplate code&lt;/strong> for simple tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Null exceptions&lt;/strong>—hated by everyone&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I’m switching to Kotlin as soon as I finish my current project (&lt;strong>Bismuth Toolbox&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Final Words &amp;amp; Reward&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="final-words--reward">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#final-words--reward" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> “Keep your friends close and your enemies closer” could be your dev motto? 😆&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Haha! Honestly, I’m not one to give programming advice—I should be the one receiving it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Bismuth Toolbox has proven its value, and that’s all we needed!&lt;br>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-08-12-defi.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />
The main difference between Bismuth and Ethereum up until this point was the level of contract decentralization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Ethereum, contracts were independent and had their own rules. In Bismuth, contract execution was still in the hands of private key owners, requiring some level of trust between participating parties. While Bismuth drastically improved scaling with its client-oriented approach and selective execution, the reliance on the contract executor was a major drawback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been generally overlooked, up until this point, that disadvantages of the Bismuth system can be removed while advantages over Ethereum can remain in place by separating contract execution from the signature mechanism and subjecting it to a specific set of rules, enabling DAO, DeFi and contracts to become genuinely more decentralized than those of Ethereum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Superiority of the client-oriented approach where consensus on the secondary layer is decided by individual users – as no central authority governs the consensus protocol above the base layer – enables upgrades to the protocol without disrupting existing versions. Therefore, any protocol upgrades can be done in real time and it is only up to users if they decide to accept upgraded versions as they can be running an unlimited number of versions at the same time without any impact on the underlying system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an axiomatic advantage over all existing smart contract platforms including Tezos, which only offers decentralized upgrades to a centralized smart contract protocol, while Bismuth lets users run all protocols at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bismuth does not enforce all nodes to be uniform and see through a single set of eyes. Much more similarly to the real world, the Bismuth model gives every participant the right for their own opinion and the way they see reality. If they choose to not comply with the central vision, they are free to have their own: to change it, upgrade it in any way. This practically results in a complete impossibility of forking, because the system is indifferent towards it. Data is data, saved on the chain. Whatever the user does with it is up to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example of this can be the Bismuth shielded token system, where encrypted data is stored on the chain and makes no sense to those who do not own the keys. However, even those without decryption keys are allowed to transfer those tokens without knowing whether they own them or not, because those with the decryption keys can still see which of the operations are valid and which are not. Shielded tokens are completely decoupled from the core node and the base layer protocol. Upgrading rules to how they or any other contracts are handled has no impact on other users and requires no developer intervention. The truest and final vision of decentralization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extending this model to smart contracts is the next logical step and requires only a simple sequence of new rules, decoupled from the base node – requiring no forking. Such contracts can have an unlimited set of rules and commands within. Practical example follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Smart contract creation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="smart-contract-creation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#smart-contract-creation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>To create a smart contract system, we first need to establish some basic rules. An initial transaction will be needed, which will describe which tokens the system will be using. For this example, we will use isolated tokens. Integration to the existing token infrastructure is preferable and will require an upgrade of the current token system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Transaction data:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="transaction-data">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#transaction-data" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;code>name:sc01&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Transaction operation:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="transaction-operation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#transaction-operation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;code>sc-origin&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is everything needed for the transaction itself, because execution rules will be stored in an interpreter. This way, users can choose the interpreter they want to use and they don’t have to share it publicly, allowing for shielded smart contracts without any further effort. You read correct, private contracts by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Local contract configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{
&amp;#39;contract_name&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;c01&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;upgradable’: true,
&amp;#39;tokens: &amp;#39;1000000&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;governance&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;token_vote-c01&amp;#39;,
&amp;#39;start_block&amp;#39; : &amp;#39;3000000&amp;#39;,

&amp;#39;allowed_operations&amp;#39;: [&amp;#39;sc-payout-c01&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sc-terminate&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sc-proposal&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sc-oracle-vote&amp;#39;]
}&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button

&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>‘governance’ defines the ruling mechanic outside of the realm of normal transactions, which are all done with private key signatures. This enables unlimited modes of governance including automatic governance based on blockchain events or coordinated oracle voting, singular oracle authority, etc. “c01” signifies custom particular rules that should not be included in any global set, but that’s all for users to agree on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‘allowed_operations’ need to be further in Python functions then used by the contract. For example: payout 100 tokens every 50 blocks to the account which received most weighted votes. That would be a simple contract demo. Another demo would be to let users vote on a real world event and then vote on payouts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Local contract executor:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="local-contract-executor">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#local-contract-executor" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The contract executor (interpretation engine) scans transactions in the ledger, searching for particular operations which are identified in the local contract configuration. Then it runs particular functions, if those operations are within rules of the contract or have not disabled by voting based on predefined rules (‘sc-proposal’ could serve for contract amendment). For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select all operations “c01“ from the blockchain. Then sort those transactions based on data: proposals, votes. Based on rules set in the contract configuration and functions linked to them, establish whether proposals are valid. Then pass the results of operations to a local database in the same way that aliases or tokens are handled currently in Bismuth. Contracts are directly integrated with oracles as no consensus is enforced.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Further scaling proposal&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="further-scaling-proposal">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#further-scaling-proposal" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Due to the nature of these contracts, all data storage can be local, unlimited and fee-less. Even contract rules can be transferred offline, saving on fees and on privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should users choose to save more data on the blockchain, it is possible to extend scaling by moving them to a decentralized storage system like IPFS and only reference hashes on the blockchain. Every contract executor can then call IPFS and pull the contract data from there. Further research on data availability may be required.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-battery-monitoring.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Tesla is a market leader in electric vehicles (EVs). They have currently sold and delivered more than 1 million EVs worldwide while production is ramping up fast with new factories in Europe and China.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Tesla Battery Monitoring on Blockchain&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="tesla-battery-monitoring-on-blockchain">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#tesla-battery-monitoring-on-blockchain" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Although EVs in general require little maintenance, one expensive component in the car needs to be treated with care: the battery. This video explains what can happen if it is not. With Tesla EVs, there is an 8-year warranty on the battery. After this period of time, there is no longer a warranty, but a car is normally expected to last much longer than this. Although battery costs are declining over time, a replacement battery would typically cost $10,000 or more nowadays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what can an owner do to maximize the lifetime of his or her EV battery? The CEO of Tesla – Elon Musk – has previously recommended to keep the battery level between 80% and 30%, see this tweet and the reply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-tweet.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The table below illustrates that the lifetime of Li-Ion batteries is limited to a number of charging cycles. As seen from the table, smaller charging cycles consume proportionally less lifetime compared with full charges. The typical lifetime of a Li-Ion battery with 0-100% charge cycles is typically 450 cycles. With 10% charge cycles, on the other hand, the lifetime would typically be 10,000 cycles or more. So, a battery with 10% charging cycles will typically achieve a double lifetime compared to one which has done 0-100% cycles, for the same kWh energy consumption. It is clear from this observation that the charging behavior of the owner will significantly influence the condition of the battery, and hence the potential resale value of the vehicle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-Li-cycle-life.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Table from the paper: Yu Miao et.al., “Current Li-Ion Battery Technologies in Electric Vehicles and Opportunities for Advancements”, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/en12061074" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://doi.org/10.3390/en12061074&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When selling an EV on the second hand market, the remaining lifetime of the battery should be one of the most important questions. However, this question could be quite difficult to answer. If the battery condition is unknown, this could affect the resale value by giving the owner a lower price regardless of the actual condition. If, on the other hand the owner can prove, somehow, that the battery was treated with care and the expected amount of remaining lifetime is significant, the resale value of the vehicle should naturally be higher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the Tesla screen inside the vehicle and also on Tesla’s phone app, it is possible to view and inspect some battery parameters. However, these parameters are lost over time. There is a plot in the car which shows the efficiency (Wh/mi or Wh/km), but this plot is limited to the last few miles or kilometers. After a certain distance those values are lost for the owner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tesla has an (unofficial) API which allows 3rd party services to log data from owner’s cars. However, by using these services you have to either expose your Tesla login credentials or give an API token to these services. Many owners do not feel comfortable doing this, because it means the 3rd party service could potentially take control over your car, not just read data. Also, there is no guarantee that a 3rd party web service will continue to exist over the lifetime of your car. The average lifetime of an app or a web service is usually considerably shorter than a vehicle. If the operator of the service decides to discontinue – for whatever reason – your vehicle data may be lost. Even if you have a backup of the data, this may not be very useful if the user interface to display and analyze the data is no longer available. Another factor is the cost: most of the 3rd party services require you to pay a monthly fee to use their service to display and analyze your own historic data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where blockchain technology enters the picture. The article &lt;a href="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/blog/2020-04-30-condition-monitoring/" >“Decentralized Condition Monitoring”&lt;/a> explains how a public blockchain can be a good solution when the following conditions are met:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>More than one participant needs to be able to submit and update data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The participants do not need to know and trust each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The data does not need to be private.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The database needs to be resistant to attacks or censorship.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For the above-mentioned reasons a solution for battery condition monitoring of Tesla EVs has been implemented by using the open source Bismuth public blockchain. Specifically, a Tesla plug-in (also called “crystal” in Bismuth terminology) has been developed for use together with the open source &lt;a href="https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/TornadoWallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TornadoWallet&lt;/a>. Some of the features of the implemented solution are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The vehicle owner will not expose his or her login credentials to anyone, since the app runs on the local computer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the code involved is open source and publicly available on GitHub on the official account of the Bismuth Foundation. Hence, anyone can verify that the software is safe to use and that there is no malicious intent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the owner submits data from the vehicle to the public blockchain, he or she can decide to publish the vehicle’s identification number (VIN) openly, or to encrypt it with a password to remain anonymous. This should ideally be a strong password, and not identical to an existing one used for other apps or services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the owner wants to sell the vehicle in the future, the password can be revealed to the new owner. The new owner can then verify that the submitted data actually belongs to the vehicle’s VIN.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first owner can transfer the virtual asset on the blockchain to the new owner, to allow the new owner to continue to submit data from the vehicle using his or her own account, while keeping the entire track record.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To discourage spam and fake data, there are some costs (fees in BIS currency) involved when registering a new VIN on the chain and to submit data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If someone submits fake data to the chain, this would most likely be detected by other users, or by new data analysis services based on the publicly available data. For example, the odometer of a car can never decrease, or the amount of energy (kWh) added should, to some extent, match the battery level and distance driven parameters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To view and analyze the data is free for everyone. A public website has been set up for this purpose, to allow anyone to view and analyze the data without owning a Tesla vehicle or the need to run the TornadoWallet on their local computer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The public website has been developed to also work well with the Tesla in-car browser (Chromium). The screenshots below are taken from an actual vehicle, for both Night and Day mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-Tesla-Bismuth-Crystal-01.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />

viewed in a Tesla vehicle (Day Mode).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have an Android phone it is also possible to run the Tesla plug-in locally by using Termux, &lt;a href="https://steinbuch.wordpress.com/2015/01/24/tesla-model-s-battery-degradation-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see link&lt;/a>. In this way, it is possible to submit vehicle data while on the road, for example just before and after charging your vehicle at a public supercharger station.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The screenshot below shows the data viewing and analysis section of the app. In this example, the vehicle IDs available for viewing have been encrypted with a password. Hence the actual VIN numbers of these cars are not available. The address on the right shows which Bismuth account has submitted the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-Tesla-Bismuth-Crystal-03.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the menu above, a vehicle asset ID is selected as well as the start and end dates. After that, a number of parameters are available for viewing and analysis. One example plot is the “Estimated Max Range vs. Odometer” and the associated curve fit, see plot below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-Tesla-Bismuth-Crystal-04.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Estimated Range vs. Odometer and Curve Fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The green dots in this plot represent individual data points submitted by the owner to the blockchain. The parameter “Estimated Max Range” is based on data from the Tesla API, by dividing the estimated remaining range with the battery level. The curve fit is based on the data points matching the “Range Filter”. In this example only the 1% largest values are used to estimate the red curve. As can be seen from this plot, the estimated max range is falling, from about 485km to 480km. However, this plot does not necessarily represent the true battery condition, since a number of parameters may influence the estimate, such as ambient temperature, driving style, road conditions, etc. The way to get a more accurate measure of maximum range is to do a full charge (0-100%) and then check the EPA rated range (in North America) or Typical range (in Europe and Asia/Pacific), see link. However, you don’t want to do this exercise too often, as a 0-100% deep charging cycle is exactly what reduces the remaining lifetime of the battery the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the owner submits data to the blockchain regularly, just before and after every charging event, it is instead possible to estimate the battery life without having to do deep charges. If all the charging events are recorded, Bismuth’s Tesla app allows for counting the cycles, using a method called rainflow counting, as illustrated in the screenshots below. The rainflow method is normally used in counting fatigue cycles in mechanical engineering, but it can also be used for counting battery cycles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-Tesla-Bismuth-Crystal-05.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-Tesla-Bismuth-Crystal-06.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Counted battery cycles and “Full Cycle Equivalent” during a selected time period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plot above shows that the owner has made several charging cycles at various levels from 10% up to 100%. By using the Li-Ion cycle life table from Miao et.al, these charging events are converted and summed up to a “Full Cycle Equivalent” of 6.03 during the time period selected (May 2020). Since the battery is expected to have a life time of about 450 full cycles, it can be estimated that 1.3% of the battery life was used up during this particular month. If this owner charges the equivalent of 6 full cycles every month, this battery can be expected to last about 77 months, or 6.5 years – significantly less than the normal expected lifetime of a car. Hence, by using the developed app, an owner can monitor the battery lifetime consumption of the vehicle on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, without performing harmful 0-100% deep charges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, there is talk about new batteries which will be capable of “a million miles” and a much higher number of charging cycles. In the paper by Harlow et.al, “&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.0981913jes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Wide Range of Testing Results on an Excellent Lithium-Ion Cell Chemistry to be used as Benchmarks for New Battery Technologies&lt;/a>” (2019) batteries with NMC532 cathodes have been found capable of higher cycle life, of 5000 or more deep charges. However, it is currently being speculated that such batteries will be used in vehicles connected to the grid (V2G), which means that deep charges could potentially happen much more frequently, perhaps even on a daily basis (charge at night when power prices are low, and sell during the day when prices are high). In such scenarios it could be of even larger importance to record the charging cycles to document remaining lifetime and ensure as high a resale value of the vehicle as possible. If and when V2G becomes a reality, the Bismuth team will make available automated data to blockchain submission scripts to capture high-frequency charging events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-05-25-Tesla-Bismuth-Crystal-07.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Bismuth’s Tesla app, PDF files can also be generated for selected dates to document, for example, total distance driven during a given period or the sum of charge energy (kWh) added. In the example above, the sum of charge energy added is found to be 131.13kWh, since there are only three actual charging events (58.49, 51.18 and 21.46 kWh) in the submitted data. Such reports could for example follow the car when sold, as an alternative to giving away the password for the asset id on the blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The remaining two screenshots below are only available in the local app, and not on the public website. The first screenshot shows the asset registration screen. Here, the Tesla credentials are entered (username and password) as well as a (strong) anonymizer password if the user does not want to expose the actual VIN number. When the asset id has been registered, it will be linked to the Bismuth wallet address by paying a small fee. Only data for this asset id submitted from this account will be visible on the public website and in the plotting and analytics section of the app. If the owner later wants to transfer the vehicle to another owner, it must first be unregistered on the chain which allows the new owner to register it. By using the same password as the previous owner the original data set for the vehicle can be continued by the new owner. If a different password is used, then the asset id will be different and a new data set will be started from scratch. The Tesla credentials (username and password) will always stay on the local computer, and are never exposed to any external websites or services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By entering the Tesla credentials and the anonymizer password (if any), battery data is collected from the vehicle. Once the data has been collected, it can be submitted to the Bismuth blockchain by paying a small fee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-04-30-condition-monitoring.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Condition monitoring (CM) is the basis for condition based maintenance (CBM). CBM is an alternative to calendar based maintenance, where an asset is serviced in regular time intervals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calendar based maintenance is easy to plan and schedule but it has some weaknesses:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Assets which are in a good condition do not need to be regularly taken out of production for service, and&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>an asset can still fail between regular calendar based maintenance events, causing downtime in production. CM and CBM are therefore used by many industries as an alternative to calendar based maintenance to strike a balance between maintenance costs and costs associated with unplanned downtime in production.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>One example from everyday life is the annual service of your car. Since it is done on a regular basis without considering the actual condition of the car, this would be classified as calendar based maintenance. On the other hand, if you one day start to feel a small vibration in the steering wheel while driving and you take the car to service because of this observation, that would be classified as condition based maintenance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CM and CBM work well in a single organisation where traditional database tools (or data historians) are used to store and secure the data. This single organisation then owns the data and can control who has access. However, when more than one organisation or individual are involved, CM and CBM initiatives often fail because of the following issue: who owns the data and controls the server storing the data? Data and data analysis can have large potential value, and organisations and individuals are often reluctant to give this value away for free or lose control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, data sharing among many participants can have large overall benefits for the group or society as a whole. A single asset does not normally operate in isolation, but forms part of a larger machinery or a plant. A condition which may be optimal for a single asset, may not be optimal for the overall machinery. By sharing data between participants, the performance of the overall machinery or industrial plant can be analyzed and optimized. Another example is the case where there are hundreds, thousands or millions of identical assets operating in the consumer industries. By sharing data, under-performing assets can be identified and corrective actions can be taken- benefiting society as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the article &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8048838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Blockchain world – Do you need a blockchain? This chart will tell you if the technology can solve your problem”&lt;/a>, IEEE Spectrum, 2017, Morgan E. Peck presented the chart below.&lt;/p>

Image from: Morgan E. Peck, “Blockchain world – Do you need a blockchain? This chart will tell you if the technology can solve your problem“, IEEE Spectrum, 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This chart illustrates that a public blockchain may be a good solution for problems where:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>More than one participant needs to be able to submit and update data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The participants do not need to know and trust each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The data does not need to be private.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The database needs to be resistant to attacks or censorship.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In this article it will be explained how the Bismuth public blockchain can be used to implement a system for distributed condition monitoring. For more information about Bismuth, see the &lt;a href="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/pdf/whitepaper.pdf" >whitepaper&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bismuth is ideally suited to this type of applications, because it contains two fields in the transaction structure which are named “operation” and “datafield”. These two fields allow for building new meta protocols on top of the core blockchain software. In this article it will be demonstrated how a new meta protocol can be used in the development of a solution for decentralized condition monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One general problem with a decentralized public blockchain is spam. Any participant can submit any data to the chain and this can not be avoided. Instead of trying to prevent spam from occurring completely, a supplementary approach would be to filter out fake data. There are several ways spam protection and filtering can be achieved, for example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Introducing fees to submit data. Anyone can still submit spam, but it will be expensive to do so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce a meta protocol built on top of Bismuth’s operation and data fields to allow for filtering of fake data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The class &lt;a href="https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/util/blob/master/bismuthsimpleasset.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BismuthSimpleAsset&lt;/a> was written with this purpose, to provide tools for filtering of fake data. This class implements at the time of writing three operations in the meta protocol:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>myapp:register
myapp:unregister
myapp:transfer&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button

title="Copy code"
>
&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The app name, in this example &lt;code>myapp&lt;/code>, can be renamed to distinguish the implementation from other use-cases also using the same public blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A physical asset often comes with a serial number or identification code printed on the asset itself somewhere. This number is in general not publicly available, but only known by the manufacturer initially, and later the customer. The manufacturer or the customer can use this identification number in Bismuth’s datafield, together with the &lt;strong>operation&lt;/strong> &lt;code>myapp:register&lt;/code> to link the serial number of the asset with his or her public/private key on the Bismuth blockchain.&lt;br>
Valid &lt;strong>asset registrations&lt;/strong> in this &lt;code>myapp&lt;/code> example can also be filtered with a minimum amount paid, to discourage spammers from randomly guessing and submitting asset id numbers. In addition to being a tool for filtering spam, a registration amount also gives the developer of the myapp use-case an income which can be used to maintain and further develop the service. Similarly, there could be an amount requirement also on the actual asset data submitted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One decentralized system everyone is familiar with and where everyone is allowed to submit data, is the email system. Anyone can set up a new email server and start sending from it. One of the techniques used in filtering email spam is to use a PTR record. A pointer record, or PTR record, maps an IP address to a FQDN (fully qualified domain name). It is the counterpart to the A record and is used for reverse DNS lookup, which can help with blocking spammers. Many SMTP servers reject emails if no PTR record is found for the sending server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proposed approach presented in this article where an asset id number is linked to the public/private key on the blockchain to filter spam is similar to the reverse DNS method to filter email spam. The first user to link the asset’s identification number to his or her account, can be considered to be the rightful owner of the asset. This information can then later be used to filter out fake data about this asset submitted by other users. The following Python function in &lt;strong>BismuthSimpleAsset&lt;/strong> returns the valid registrant given an asset id:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>def get_registrant(self,asset_id):
&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Returns the current registrant of a specified asset id&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
regs = self.__get_reg_unreg_sorted(asset_id)
registrant = self.__get_registrant_from_regs(regs)

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>If the asset owner later wants to release his or her registration of the asset, this can be done by submitting the &lt;strong>operation&lt;/strong> &lt;code>myapp:unregister&lt;/code> together with the asset id in the &lt;strong>datafield&lt;/strong>. Alternatively, the asset owner can transfer the ownership of the asset to another account by submitting the operation myapp:transfer together with the following in the &lt;strong>datafield&lt;/strong>: &lt;code>asset_id,new address&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another function in the BismuthSimpleAsset class- &lt;code>get_all_asset_ids()&lt;/code> -returns all valid asset id numbers and associated Bismuth accounts. This function handles multiple register, unregister and transfer events of assets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whenever a participant submits data to the public blockchain, the command &lt;code>myapp:data&lt;/code> can for example be used, or something more specific, for example &lt;code>myapp:vibration_data&lt;/code>. In the datafield a JSON string can be submitted, allowing for a flexible list of variables to be used. The asset id should be part of this JSON structure, to allow the filtering of fake data. Bismuth allows for a string of up to &lt;strong>100,000 characters in the datafield&lt;/strong>, so relatively large amount of data can be submitted. However, the transaction fee increases linearly with the data size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a decentralized public blockchain with open data for everyone to access has potentially many benefits. Some of the benefits are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It allows for independent 3rd party data analysts to offer services to the participants. This analysis can for example tell you about the performance of your asset, and what you can do to improve it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If someone registers a valid asset id and starts submitting fake data, this can potentially be detected by 3rd party data analysis. For example, some physical variables like the odometer value of a car can only increase over time. Invalid data based on more complex relationships between variables can potentially also be detected. The 3rd party service could then for example offer a whitelist and blacklist of asset id numbers, to allow for even more advanced data filtering.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The owner of an asset can compare the performance of his or her asset with other peers, detect sub-optimal performance, and apply corrective actions.
If the owner later wants to sell the asset to someone else, he or she can provide proof of asset performance during it’s lifetime to the new owner by using the publicly available data. By giving proof that the asset has been operated with care and within the specifications, the resale value of the asset may be higher than it otherwise would be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An increasing number of assets and consumer products are connected to the internet, and come with API interfaces which the owner or operator can use. Hence, the submission of data to the public blockchain can easily be automated or semi-automated for such assets.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This article has given an introduction to some building blocks for decentralized condition monitoring using the Bismuth public blockchain. Several future applications and implementations using the principles laid out here are currently being worked on and will be published separately when ready.&lt;/p>

Bismuth is a chemical element and a metal with number 83 in the periodic table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bismuth has an unusual property for a metal in which it expands as it changes from a liquid to a solid and crystals are formed. Bismuth is also the name given to the first blockchain implementation written in Python. The Bismuth blockchain project with it’s associated features and tools aim to be a “construction set for blockchain technology” or “the Lego of blockchains”. Inspired by the metal the Bismuth blockchain ecosystem will also “expand as it solidifies”, with many new developers and future use-cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tornado is a Python-based web framework and asynchronous networking library. It is an ideal framework for a Bismuth wallet and distributed app (Dapp) development environment. Motivated by the metal and in the spirit of being a construction set, the Tornado wallet also has a plugin feature which has been given the name “Crystal”. In this blog article the crystal framework in Bismuth’s Tornado wallet is introduced with a “Hello World” example. The article is written with the goal to help new Dapp developers getting started with the Bismuth ecosystem. Specifically, the Hello World crystal demonstrates the following features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Collecting blockchain data using the library bismuthclient&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Collecting data from a 3rd party API&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Displaying data with html using Tornado templates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Displaying a pop-up message using get/post methods and javascript&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each crystal in the wallet is given a unique number, followed by an underscore and the name, in this case it is: &lt;code>101_helloworld&lt;/code>. The figure below shows the files and folder structure of the Hello World crystal. The example consists of one Python file (&lt;code>__init__.py&lt;/code>), one data file (&lt;code>about.json&lt;/code>), one graphics file (&lt;code>logo.png&lt;/code>), and three html files (&lt;code>about.html&lt;/code>, &lt;code>message_pop.html&lt;/code> and &lt;code>page1.html&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hello World Crystal Files and Folders.&lt;br>
General information about a crystal can be found in the &lt;code>about.json&lt;/code> file. In this example the contents is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{

}&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button
class="hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50"
title="Copy code"
>
&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The main file of the HelloWorld crystal is the Python file &lt;code>__init__.py&lt;/code>. This file contains a class named &lt;code>HelloworldHandler&lt;/code> which again contains 7 functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first four functions, &lt;code>get()&lt;/code>, &lt;code>post()&lt;/code>, &lt;code>get_template_path()&lt;/code> and &lt;code>static()&lt;/code>, are generic and should be part of any crystal. The two functions &lt;code>get()&lt;/code> and &lt;code>post()&lt;/code> handle get and post form requests from html or javascript and will be described later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The function &lt;code>get_template_path()&lt;/code> just returns &lt;code>DEFAULT_THEME_PATH&lt;/code>, to let Tornado know where to find the html files. In the Hello World crystal this path is defined to be the base path plus &lt;code>crystals/101_helloworld/themes/default&lt;/code> The fourth function, &lt;code>static()&lt;/code> just creates a static handler pointing to a local /static crystal folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fifth function, about(), contains the following Python code:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>async def about(self, params=None):
self.render(&amp;#34;about.html&amp;#34;, bismuth=self.bismuth_vars)&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button
class="hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50"
title="Copy code"
>
&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It means that when Tornado receives an url request of &lt;code>http://127.0.0.1:8888/crystal/helloworld/about&lt;/code> the &lt;code>about()&lt;/code> Python function inside &lt;code>__init__.py&lt;/code> is called. All this function does is to render the &lt;code>about.html&lt;/code> file and pass the variable “bismuth” to it. The html file &lt;code>about.html&lt;/code> is stored in the folder specified by DEFAULT_THEME_PATH. The file &lt;code>about.html&lt;/code> contains the opening screen of the crystal &lt;code>101_helloworld&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bismuth’s Tornado wallet is based on the Material Dashboard Dark Edition and the documentation for it can be found here: &lt;a href="https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-dashboard-dark/docs/2.0/getting-started/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-dashboard-dark/docs/2.0/getting-started/introduction.html&lt;/a> For example, the button in the figure above is formatted using: &lt;code>class=”btn btn-success”&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The displayed logo is the file &lt;code>logo.png&lt;/code> in the &lt;code>static/&lt;/code> folder. The first two lines of code in &lt;code>about.html&lt;/code> are:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{% extends &amp;#34;base.html&amp;#34; %}
&amp;lt;!-- &amp;#34;../../../../themes/material/base.html&amp;#34; --&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button
class="hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50"
title="Copy code"
>
&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The symbols {% and %} are used by the Tornado templates. In this case &lt;code>about.html&lt;/code> extends the parent wallet file &lt;code>base.html&lt;/code>. The crystal can then make use of styling and formatting inherited from the wallet. The theme and css framework in the Tornado wallet try to be semantic. For example, the css uses success/danger/error/info as class names, so it does not depend on a specific color theme and remains consistent. If the Tornado wallet were later to switch to another template, there would be no changes required in the crystals such as color or css. If the devs always use for example “-danger” the crystals would use the theme color for that. Keeping this in mind ensures that the crystals will be compatible with alternative themes. As an example the following two lines in about.html:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;card-header card-header-info&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;card-header card-header-success&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button
class="hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50"
title="Copy code"
>
&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>generate the turqoise and green menus labeled “About” and “Menu”, respectively, in the screenshot above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except for the Tornado templates, &lt;code>about.html&lt;/code> contains pure html code. When clicked, the command button in &lt;code>about.html&lt;/code> opens up &lt;code>page1&lt;/code>. When &lt;code>page1.html&lt;/code> opens it displays two cards named “Commands” using &lt;code>card-header-info&lt;/code> (turqoise color) and “Output” using &lt;code>card-header-success&lt;/code> (green color). The Commands card contains 4 buttons and a text input field. The first button “Show Latest Account Transactions” generates a &lt;code>&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code> in the Output card with data obtained from the blockchain for the active account in the wallet. The Python code to obtain the blockchain data is:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>button1 = self.get_argument(&amp;#34;button1&amp;#34;, default=None, strip=False)
if button1 is not None:
data[&amp;#39;txs&amp;#39;] = self.bismuth.latest_transactions(5, for_display=True, mempool_included=True)
...
self.render(&amp;#34;page1.html&amp;#34;, bismuth=self.bismuth_vars, data=data)&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">

&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The dict data[‘txs’] is passed back to page1.html where it is rendered using the following Tornado templates:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Block Height&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Amount&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Recipient&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Timestamp&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
{% for item in data[&amp;#39;txs&amp;#39;] %}
{% block item %}
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{{ item[&amp;#39;block_height&amp;#39;] }}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{{ item[&amp;#39;amount&amp;#39;] }}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{{ item[&amp;#39;recipient&amp;#39;] }}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{{ datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(item[&amp;#39;timestamp&amp;#39;]).strftime(&amp;#39;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&amp;#39;) }}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;

&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The Tornado template {{ variable_name }} outputs the Python variable into the html page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second button “Show Hypernodes” collects data from an external site using the following Python code:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>button2 = self.get_argument(&amp;#34;button2&amp;#34;, default=None, strip=False)
if button2 is not None:

...
self.render(&amp;#34;page1.html&amp;#34;, bismuth=self.bismuth_vars, data=data)&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button

&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The dict data[‘hns’] is then rendered in &lt;code>page1.html&lt;/code> using Tornado templates as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;IP Address&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Height&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
{% for key,value in data[&amp;#39;hns&amp;#39;].items() %}

{% else %}
&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;{{ value }}&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
{% end %}
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
{% end %}
{% end %}
&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">
&lt;button

&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As can be seen from this example, Tornado templates allow for embedding Python code into the html file to display data, similar to the templates &lt;code>&amp;lt;?php … ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code> for those familiar with PHP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last two buttons in &lt;code>page1.html&lt;/code> generate the “Hello World” pop-up message. When clicking on either of these two buttons, one of two javascript functions, &lt;code>message_get()&lt;/code> or &lt;code>message_post()&lt;/code>, defined in &lt;code>page1.html&lt;/code> is called. The two javascript functions are implemented as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;

&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Note that the _xsrf token is required in order to post data. In addition the following template must be included in page1.html in order to allow posting:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{% raw xsrf_form_html() %}&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In some cases it is preferred to post() data to Tornado instead of &lt;code>get()&lt;/code> to avoid the data being displayed in the url at the top of the browser. Examples are cases where the end-user has to type in a password or a pin code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The javascript functions call the Python function &lt;code>message_popup()&lt;/code> which contains the following code:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>async def message_popup(self, params=None):

&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The type can be either “info”, “warning” or “danger” resulting in different colors used in the pop up message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The file &lt;code>page1.html&lt;/code> includes a hidden element:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#34;message_window&amp;#34; class=&amp;#34;modal&amp;#34; tabindex=&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34; role=&amp;#34;dialog&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0">

&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The hidden “message_window” gets replaced by the html code inside message_pop.html by the following two commands in the javascript callback function:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$(&amp;#34;#message_window&amp;#34;).html(page);

&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The pop-up is therefore not a separate window in the browser, but is part of the page1.html file. The steps involved to generate this pop-up include a combination of javascript and Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The screen page1.html after clicking “Show Hypernodes” followed by Submit (Post).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The screenshot below shows the page1.html screen after “Show Hypernodes” followed by “Submit (Post)” have been clicked. The message inside the pop-up window is generated from the text input field above the two Submit buttons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog article has described the file structure and contents of the Hello World crystal in Bismuth’s Tornado wallet. The purpose of this article has been to explain some common functions and features which are believed that most future Dapp developers will need (display of blockchain and 3rd party data, interaction between Python, javascript and html and display of messages).&lt;/p>

Welcome to another edition of &lt;strong>BisBabble&lt;/strong>! In this episode, we chat with &lt;strong>ShadowCrypto&lt;/strong>, a dedicated &lt;strong>Bismuth supporter&lt;/strong> and key contributor to the &lt;strong>Pawer bot&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The Interview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-interview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-interview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;h4>Q: Hello Shadow! We heard about you in a previous BisBabble episode. You are a vibrant supporter of Bismuth and a much-appreciated code contributor to the Pawer bot. Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-hello-shadow-we-heard-about-you-in-a-previous-bisbabble-episode-you-are-a-vibrant-supporter-of-bismuth-and-a-much-appreciated-code-contributor-to-the-pawer-bot-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself">&lt;/span>

&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Since forums don’t allow for direct observation, how do you describe yourself at dinner parties?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-since-forums-dont-allow-for-direct-observation-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-since-forums-dont-allow-for-direct-observation-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> As an &lt;strong>introvert&lt;/strong>, I prefer to stay silent and focus on the main purpose—&lt;strong>eating, a lot!&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Well, introvert maybe, but you were the one who brought @aravindballa to the party—thanks for that! How did you get into programming in the first place?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-well-introvert-maybe-but-you-were-the-one-who-brought-aravindballa-to-the-partythanks-for-that-how-did-you-get-into-programming-in-the-first-place">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-well-introvert-maybe-but-you-were-the-one-who-brought-aravindballa-to-the-partythanks-for-that-how-did-you-get-into-programming-in-the-first-place" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I have an interesting backstory for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When I finished school and had to choose a field of study, I told my cousin, &lt;strong>“Anything except computers.”&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A couple of years later, I ended up doing my &lt;strong>undergraduate degree in Computer Science&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I &lt;strong>never regretted it&lt;/strong>—every day was fun!&lt;br>
I first encountered coding through coursework and was &lt;strong>fascinated&lt;/strong> by how &lt;strong>a few lines of code&lt;/strong> could perform &lt;strong>complex tasks&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
That simple realization keeps me &lt;strong>motivated&lt;/strong> to this day.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: The preferred minimalism can be seen in your code. So, programming is your day job?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-the-preferred-minimalism-can-be-seen-in-your-code-so-programming-is-your-day-job">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-the-preferred-minimalism-can-be-seen-in-your-code-so-programming-is-your-day-job" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Yes, I &lt;strong>pay my bills&lt;/strong> with programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Like many others—&lt;strong>through Bitcoin&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Initially, I was interested in &lt;strong>crypto as an investment&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At first, &lt;strong>Bitcoin’s technical details were overwhelming&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Over time, I took the time to &lt;strong>understand it better&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I still don’t know &lt;strong>everything in detail&lt;/strong>, but I now have a &lt;strong>decent high-level understanding&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What’s the piece of code you’re most proud of?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-the-piece-of-code-youre-most-proud-of">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-the-piece-of-code-youre-most-proud-of" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Back when I was &lt;strong>new to HTML &amp;amp; CSS&lt;/strong>, I worked on &lt;strong>email templates&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I migrated existing templates to &lt;strong>plain HTML &amp;amp; CSS/SASS&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reduced &lt;strong>1700 lines of code to 450&lt;/strong> per template.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supported all browsers &amp;amp; mail clients.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There were &lt;strong>10 such templates&lt;/strong> in total!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It was a great &lt;strong>learning and implementation experience&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Minimalism again! What programming languages have you worked with?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-minimalism-again-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-minimalism-again-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong> &amp;amp; &lt;strong>Java&lt;/strong> (mostly).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>C/C++?&lt;/strong> Still unsure if I should count them—I started with them but didn’t continue afterward.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What led you to Bismuth?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-led-you-to-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-led-you-to-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>@cryptotyrion&lt;/strong> introduced me to Bismuth.&lt;br>
The fact that it was &lt;strong>written in Python&lt;/strong> (my favorite language) made me &lt;strong>dig deeper&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I’ve been an &lt;strong>investor/trader since 2017&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest strength?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>The devs.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m amazed at how &lt;strong>hard and smart they work&lt;/strong>, even in the toughest times.&lt;br>
Also, the &lt;strong>community is incredibly welcoming&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bismuth was my &lt;strong>first open-source contribution&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
At first, I had &lt;strong>many fears&lt;/strong> about where to start, but the &lt;strong>devs made it easy&lt;/strong> and were &lt;strong>super helpful&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
It’s a &lt;strong>perfect learning environment&lt;/strong> for blockchain development—especially in &lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Thanks! We try to be welcoming because we need contributors like you—and you’ve proved yourself! What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest weakness?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-thanks-we-try-to-be-welcoming-because-we-need-contributors-like-youand-youve-proved-yourself-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-weakness">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-thanks-we-try-to-be-welcoming-because-we-need-contributors-like-youand-youve-proved-yourself-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-weakness" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>The business model.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I may be &lt;strong>wrong or less informed&lt;/strong>, but I don’t fully understand how &lt;strong>Bismuth generates money&lt;/strong> within its ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: You’ve mainly worked on the Pawer Discord bot. Are there other parts of Bismuth’s ecosystem you’d like to explore?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-youve-mainly-worked-on-the-pawer-discord-bot-are-there-other-parts-of-bismuths-ecosystem-youd-like-to-explore">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-youve-mainly-worked-on-the-pawer-discord-bot-are-there-other-parts-of-bismuths-ecosystem-youd-like-to-explore" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Absolutely!&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
I’d love to explore:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ZircoDice&lt;/strong> 🎲&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dragginator&lt;/strong> 🐉&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other &lt;strong>DApps&lt;/strong> 🚀&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I also want to &lt;strong>build my own DApp&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
If anyone has &lt;strong>ideas and needs a partner, hit me up!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Most loved programming language &amp;amp; why?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-loved-programming-language--why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-loved-programming-language--why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong>—as simple as &lt;strong>writing a few statements in English&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Most hated programming language &amp;amp; why?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-hated-programming-language--why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-hated-programming-language--why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I haven’t figured that out yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: You’ll live longer if you only love and don’t hate—good call! On a more personal note, what are you up to when you’re not coding?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-youll-live-longer-if-you-only-love-and-dont-hategood-call-on-a-more-personal-note-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-youll-live-longer-if-you-only-love-and-dont-hategood-call-on-a-more-personal-note-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I’m a &lt;strong>photographer at heart&lt;/strong>—that’s what keeps me alive. 📷&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love finding &lt;strong>patterns, symmetry, and silhouettes&lt;/strong> in unexpected places.&lt;br>
Also, I won a &lt;strong>national-level award&lt;/strong> and received a &lt;strong>few other recognitions&lt;/strong>—making my parents proud at a young age.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Do you see any connections between photography and coding?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-do-you-see-any-connections-between-photography-and-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-do-you-see-any-connections-between-photography-and-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Great question!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, &lt;strong>programming is also an art form&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People express &lt;strong>creativity in different ways&lt;/strong>—programming is one of them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Photography and coding &lt;strong>share similarities&lt;/strong>—composing a &lt;strong>shot&lt;/strong> vs. composing a &lt;strong>function&lt;/strong>,&lt;br>
keeping things &lt;strong>minimal&lt;/strong>, finding &lt;strong>patterns&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>reusing&lt;/strong> them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both give me the &lt;strong>same dopamine hit&lt;/strong>—whether I &lt;strong>capture a great photo&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>write a beautiful script&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4>Q: Your best piece of programming advice?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice">&lt;/span>

💡 &lt;strong>You can automate daily tasks or build fun projects—just for fun!&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
💡 &lt;strong>Not everything you learn has to make money—enjoy programming!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

In this second issue of the &lt;strong>“BisBabble”&lt;/strong> series we welcome &lt;strong>Endogen&lt;/strong>, a long-time Bismuth supporter and developer of the &lt;strong>Bismuth Telegram Bot, Bauer&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>📝 The Interview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="-the-interview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#-the-interview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Sure! I’m a &lt;strong>38-year-old software engineer from Germany&lt;/strong>, but I’ve only been in the software industry for about &lt;strong>8 years&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Before that, I worked as a &lt;strong>retail salesman for an electronics retailer&lt;/strong>, but I didn’t enjoy it—so I decided to &lt;strong>study Software Engineering&lt;/strong> 🙂.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a kid, I was naturally drawn to the &lt;strong>internet&lt;/strong> and fascinated by &lt;strong>software&lt;/strong>. Unlike everything else that seemed to decay over time, software &lt;strong>stayed the same&lt;/strong>—I found that really interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I work as a &lt;strong>SAP consultant&lt;/strong>, helping companies implement &lt;strong>SAP ME (Manufacturing Execution)&lt;/strong> to create &lt;strong>paperless plants&lt;/strong>. Unfortunately, I no longer code at work, but I still love it and do it privately for fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: How do you describe yourself at dinner parties?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-do-you-describe-yourself-at-dinner-parties" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I &lt;strong>don’t&lt;/strong>. I prefer to stay in the background and listen to people 😉.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if I had to, I’d say I’m &lt;strong>drawn to things outside the mainstream&lt;/strong>. Life is too short to be bored by &lt;strong>mediocre stuff&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
For example, I’ve always been fascinated by &lt;strong>psychoactive drugs, consciousness, and philosophical theories&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
However, after having &lt;strong>two kids&lt;/strong>, responsibility took over—but I’m sure I’m still &lt;strong>strange as hell&lt;/strong> 😆.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s what I’d say at a dinner party. And the &lt;strong>one or two people still cool with me after that?&lt;/strong> Those are the ones I’d have a beer with.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What made you want to start coding?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-made-you-want-to-start-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-made-you-want-to-start-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I love the idea of &lt;strong>creating something from nothing&lt;/strong>. Software is especially interesting because of its &lt;strong>unique properties&lt;/strong>—once it exists, it can be &lt;strong>used anywhere by anyone&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that &lt;strong>someone can write code, publish it on GitHub, and people worldwide can use it&lt;/strong> fascinates me.&lt;br>
I believe &lt;strong>proprietary software will become niche&lt;/strong> in the future—so everything I code privately will always be &lt;strong>open source&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Is programming your day job or a hobby?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> It was my &lt;strong>day job for a short time&lt;/strong>, but now it’s just a &lt;strong>hobby&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
I’m not the &lt;strong>best&lt;/strong> programmer, and I have &lt;strong>other skills&lt;/strong>, but I &lt;strong>love coding&lt;/strong> and do it in my free time.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I first heard about &lt;strong>Bitcoin&lt;/strong> while studying. I thought it was cool but didn’t look into it much.&lt;br>
Years later, when I saw that these &lt;strong>coins actually had value&lt;/strong>, I started digging deeper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was fascinated by the &lt;strong>decentralization, censorship resistance, and independence from traditional finance&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
It was obvious—&lt;strong>this is the start of a new paradigm&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What piece of code do you wish you had written?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-piece-of-code-do-you-wish-you-had-written">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-piece-of-code-do-you-wish-you-had-written" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>TensorFlow&lt;/strong> 😀&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What code are you most proud of?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-code-are-you-most-proud-of">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-code-are-you-most-proud-of" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Honestly? &lt;strong>The Bismuth Telegram Bot&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
It may sound silly, but it’s the &lt;strong>first&lt;/strong> project where I really liked how the code was structured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And hey—I even got &lt;strong>paid&lt;/strong> for coding in my free time! YAY! 🎉&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What programming languages have you worked with?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Java&lt;/strong> (for work) – liked it at first.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong> (privately) – loved it. Since then, I never touched any other language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JavaScript &amp;amp; Vue&lt;/strong> – played around briefly, but nothing serious.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What led you to Bismuth?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-led-you-to-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-led-you-to-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I love the &lt;strong>crypto industry&lt;/strong>—it’s hilariously &lt;strong>scammy, overblown, and overvalued&lt;/strong>. But on a serious note, it’s &lt;strong>the future&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
No one can stop it—it will &lt;strong>drag the world with it&lt;/strong>, no matter what anyone tries to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I’m also &lt;strong>obsessed with Python&lt;/strong>, I looked for a &lt;strong>Python-based blockchain&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
I didn’t want just a &lt;strong>Python client&lt;/strong>—I wanted something I could &lt;strong>tear apart and understand&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how I found &lt;strong>Bismuth&lt;/strong>. When I saw the &lt;strong>logo&lt;/strong> and its connection to the &lt;strong>chemical element&lt;/strong>, I was hooked.&lt;br>
I love &lt;strong>fractals&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Bismuth reminds me of that&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First got into &lt;strong>Bitcoin&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then found &lt;strong>Monero (XMR)&lt;/strong>—loved the idea, but disliked &lt;strong>C++&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Got involved with &lt;strong>Monero’s ecosystem&lt;/strong> (created a proposal for a Monero Marketplace Bot – &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4xc98x4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🔗 Proposal&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>With Bismuth, I could finally get into the code&lt;/strong>, which I loved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also &lt;strong>enjoy trading&lt;/strong>—not good at it, but for me, it’s a &lt;strong>game &amp;amp; hobby&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest strength?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-strength" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>It’s coded in Python.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
That fact alone attracts a lot of &lt;strong>competent developers&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Combined with Bismuth’s &lt;strong>features&lt;/strong>, it’s an &lt;strong>exciting and fun&lt;/strong> project.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What would you say is Bismuth’s biggest weakness?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-weakness">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-would-you-say-is-bismuths-biggest-weakness" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>The code itself.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The ideas behind Bismuth are &lt;strong>brilliant&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>HCLivess (Bismuth’s creator) is godlike&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the &lt;strong>code structure needs improvement&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Any thoughts on the current crypto industry?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-any-thoughts-on-the-current-crypto-industry">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-any-thoughts-on-the-current-crypto-industry" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> The next big thing? &lt;strong>Mining isn’t the way forward.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need &lt;strong>nodes that directly validate and store transactions&lt;/strong>, receiving fees &lt;strong>without intermediaries&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
If your blockchain &lt;strong>requires a second layer&lt;/strong>, then your &lt;strong>first layer isn’t the future&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also—&lt;strong>Gossip protocols, WTF.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Most loved programming language, and why?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-loved-programming-language-and-why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-loved-programming-language-and-why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Python! Python! Python!&lt;/strong> 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Most hated programming language, and why?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-hated-programming-language-and-why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-hated-programming-language-and-why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I can’t judge many languages, but between &lt;strong>Python and Java&lt;/strong>—I find Java &lt;strong>boring&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
After &lt;strong>falling in love with Python&lt;/strong>, I &lt;strong>never needed anything else&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What are you up to when you’re not coding?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-are-you-up-to-when-youre-not-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Playing with my &lt;strong>kids&lt;/strong> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thinking about &lt;strong>obscure stuff&lt;/strong> 🤯&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Gardening&lt;/strong> 🌱&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hanging out with &lt;strong>friends&lt;/strong> 🍻&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Downhill biking&lt;/strong> 🚴 (but no time for it anymore—kids come first!).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I &lt;strong>don’t&lt;/strong> take life &lt;strong>too seriously&lt;/strong> and avoid most &lt;strong>social activities&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Your best piece of programming advice?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
❌ &lt;strong>Don’t read books about programming.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
✅ &lt;strong>Just code.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>🙏 &lt;strong>Thanks a lot, Endogen, for answering our questions! Keep up the great work!&lt;/strong> 🚀&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2020-01-18-interview.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Welcome to the &lt;strong>BisBabble&lt;/strong> series! In this issue, we chat with &lt;strong>Aravind&lt;/strong>, a recent contributor to the Bismuth project.&lt;br>
He shares insights into his background, interests, and development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>📝 The Interview&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="-the-interview">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#-the-interview" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Can you tell us a little about yourself?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I make sure I taste &lt;strong>all the varieties&lt;/strong> of food being served. 🍽️&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Is programming your day job or a hobby?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-is-programming-your-day-job-or-a-hobby" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> It’s my &lt;strong>day job&lt;/strong>—I work as a &lt;strong>JavaScript Developer&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Code you’re most proud of?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-code-youre-most-proud-of">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-code-youre-most-proud-of" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> My &lt;strong>personal website&lt;/strong> (I guess).&lt;br>
There’s a module that &lt;strong>dynamically generates social media preview images (Open Graph) when the site builds&lt;/strong>—I really like that part.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What programming languages have you worked with?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-programming-languages-have-you-worked-with" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>C&lt;/strong> – Learned it, but never liked it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python&lt;/strong> – Enjoyed using &lt;strong>Django&lt;/strong> to build things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Java&lt;/strong> – My first paid job was in Java, but I wasn’t a fan—maybe because of how I learned it in college.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: You give talks about cutting-edge tech (like Gatsby). Do you see that as part of your job?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-you-give-talks-about-cutting-edge-tech-like-gatsby-do-you-see-that-as-part-of-your-job">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-you-give-talks-about-cutting-edge-tech-like-gatsby-do-you-see-that-as-part-of-your-job" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I love &lt;strong>sharing what I learn&lt;/strong> and helping others on their developer journey. That’s why I &lt;strong>write a blog&lt;/strong>, too—it’s a pleasure!&lt;br>
Also, I feel &lt;strong>noticed in the community&lt;/strong> when I talk about what I’ve learned.&lt;br>
I believe &lt;strong>everyone should share&lt;/strong>, because it’s &lt;strong>beautiful to see different perspectives&lt;/strong>—sometimes they &lt;strong>open new doors&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What’s your experience in the crypto field?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-whats-your-experience-in-the-crypto-field" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> I’d say I’m a &lt;strong>beginner&lt;/strong> who &lt;strong>understands what a blockchain is&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: How did you get introduced to blockchain?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-how-did-you-get-introduced-to-blockchain" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In college, I heard about a guy &lt;strong>making money trading crypto&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I asked him &lt;strong>what a blockchain was&lt;/strong>—he couldn’t explain it properly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That led me to &lt;strong>do some research&lt;/strong>, but I was still confused.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A year ago, I met someone who &lt;strong>runs a blockchain-based company&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talking to him gave me &lt;strong>clarity&lt;/strong> and motivated me to &lt;strong>learn more&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What led you to Bismuth specifically?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-led-you-to-bismuth-specifically">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-led-you-to-bismuth-specifically" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>All because of Shadowcrypto.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Has the perception of crypto changed for you since that college trader?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-has-the-perception-of-crypto-changed-for-you-since-that-college-trader">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-has-the-perception-of-crypto-changed-for-you-since-that-college-trader" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Absolutely—&lt;strong>a lot has changed&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
For me, &lt;strong>crypto is already influencing the world&lt;/strong>, but it will take time for people around me to &lt;strong>fully adopt it&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
I’ve even read that &lt;strong>my state government is using blockchain (not exactly crypto) for certain projects&lt;/strong>, which is interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What do you like about Bismuth?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-do-you-like-about-bismuth">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-do-you-like-about-bismuth" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> The &lt;strong>community&lt;/strong>—you all are so nice! 🤗&lt;br>
Also, Bismuth is &lt;strong>written in Python&lt;/strong>, the only language I understand apart from &lt;strong>JavaScript&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Most loved programming language &amp;amp; why?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-most-loved-programming-language--why">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-most-loved-programming-language--why" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>JavaScript&lt;/strong> (of course).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It started as just a &lt;strong>browser scripting language&lt;/strong>, but after the &lt;strong>V8 engine&lt;/strong>, it became &lt;strong>much more powerful&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Now, you can &lt;strong>write it anywhere&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Webpages&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Servers&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mobile (Ionic, React Native)&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>IoT devices&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Learn once, use everywhere!&lt;/strong> 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Many modern developers rely on libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Laravel). Do you see this as a good thing?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-many-modern-developers-rely-on-libraries-and-frameworks-eg-react-laravel-do-you-see-this-as-a-good-thing">&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Frameworks &lt;strong>abstract things developers don’t need to worry about&lt;/strong>, allowing them to &lt;strong>focus on business logic&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
For example, &lt;strong>React&lt;/strong> abstracts &lt;strong>DOM updates&lt;/strong> with its &lt;strong>Virtual DOM&lt;/strong>, making it far better than manually updating the DOM with &lt;strong>JavaScript or jQuery&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: What do you do when you’re not coding?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-what-do-you-do-when-youre-not-coding">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#q-what-do-you-do-when-youre-not-coding" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Trekking in the Himalayas&lt;/strong> 🏔️ (most of my vacations this year were for that).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hiking&lt;/strong> 🚶&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Drawing&lt;/strong> 🎨&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Is your off-work routine completely separate from your work, or do you get “aha” moments?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-is-your-off-work-routine-completely-separate-from-your-work-or-do-you-get-aha-moments">&lt;/span>

Sometimes, I work on an &lt;strong>interesting side project&lt;/strong> (involving code), and that feels like a &lt;strong>good break, too&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
So it’s a &lt;strong>mix and match&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Developers are often stereotyped as geeks, but the best programmers often have creative/artistic sides. Do you agree?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-developers-are-often-stereotyped-as-geeks-but-the-best-programmers-often-have-creativeartistic-sides-do-you-agree">&lt;/span>

I &lt;strong>see code as art&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently started &lt;strong>reading other people’s code&lt;/strong>, and it’s &lt;strong>beautiful&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
Creativity isn’t just about &lt;strong>UI or aesthetics&lt;/strong>—it’s also about &lt;strong>how elegantly the code is written&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>&lt;strong>Q: Your best piece of programming advice?&lt;/strong>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="q-your-best-piece-of-programming-advice">&lt;/span>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-11-19-hardfork.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />
During November 2019 the Bismuth community went with the first governance vote, about supply emission. The issue was overwhelming votes for a fork to support a supply reduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you missed it, you can find the &lt;a href="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/blog/2019-11-06-governance-vote/" >link here&lt;/a>. Since then, the team worked hard to implement the change and release a stable version, now out.
Questions and answers regarding this fork have been divided into three categories- Regular users, Hypernode owners, and miners.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Bismuth Hard Fork at block 1,450,000 – Nov 26.&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="bismuth-hard-fork-at-block-1450000--nov-26">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#bismuth-hard-fork-at-block-1450000--nov-26" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>Hard Fork FAQ&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="hard-fork-faq">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#hard-fork-faq" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;h3>General Questions&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="general-questions">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#general-questions" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Can you explain why there will be a hard fork?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> A hard fork was scheduled in response to the first Bismuth community vote. It’s the result of a democratic process that showed significant involvement from the Bismuth community.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> When is the Hard Fork taking place?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> The HF will occur at block 1,450,000, roughly on November 26.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>Regular Users&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="regular-users">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#regular-users" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Do I have to DO anything? New wallet? No swapping BS or anything, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Regular wallet owners can optionally upgrade; however, it is not necessary. It will continue to work. Mandatory upgrades apply only to node and Hypernode owners. There is no swap.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Is it still OK to use the old wallet, or should I upgrade to Tornado?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> The “old” (Legacy) wallet remains compatible and usable. You don’t have to worry about the wallet. Yours will continue to work. As a user, the only critical responsibility is to securely back up your wallet.der/json file, containing your private key(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Can you summarize the current daily emission and what it will be after the hard fork?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> See the emission curve and blog post &lt;a href="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/blog/2019-11-06-governance-vote/" >here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> What will be the new total BIS supply?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> By 2032, at block height 8,000,000, the total BIS supply will reach 49.3 million BIS, compared to 63.5 million BIS under the previous emissions curve. Thus, the supply will decrease by more than 14 million BIS over the next 13 years. After 2032, the supply will slowly increase (less than 2% annually) to account for lost wallets and maintain incentives for miners and Hypernode operators.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Can you see a scenario where the chain splits in two?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Every hard fork technically involves a chain split; however, the legacy chain typically dies off due to lack of support. Miners, exchanges, and the economic majority support the v4.4.0 hard fork proposal, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about a competing legacy chain.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Have you informed exchanges to avoid any trading halt, as happened previously?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> All partners, exchanges, service operators, and pools have been informed. All recent forks proceeded smoothly without trading halts.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>Hypernode and Node Owners&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="hypernode-and-node-owners">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#hypernode-and-node-owners" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> After the hard fork, how can I re-operate my Hypernode? Will I need to do anything with my HN?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Every Hypernode relies on a local Node to operate. Hypernodes using version 0.0.99i5 don&amp;rsquo;t need updating, but the local BIS node does. It’s mandatory to upgrade your node to the latest release &lt;strong>BEFORE&lt;/strong> the fork. &lt;a href="https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node Releases&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Will there be a Hypernode update tutorial before the hard fork?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Yes. We&amp;rsquo;ve updated our easy-to-use update script, covering common scenarios:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run the following commands in your Hypernode terminal:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code">
&lt;div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">rm hn_node_update.py

&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4">&lt;/div>
&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The script requires Python 3.7 and will prompt you about missing packages if needed. For feedback, visit the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/4tB3pYJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord #hypernodes channel&lt;/a>. Additional manual update instructions can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/blob/master/Hypernodes/Hypernodes_Upgrade_0-0-99.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> What will be the new annual yield for running a BIS Hypernode after the fork?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> Yield depends on the number of Hypernode operators. If total collateral remains stable, the yield will initially stay around 20%, aligning with a 19.4% inflation rate. Hypernode owners will no longer experience dilution post-fork. In the second year, inflation will drop below 15%, potentially leading to net positive income after inflation.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> What if I don’t upgrade in time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> All other BIS nodes will curse then ban you. Immediate upgrading is essential, both for the network&amp;rsquo;s health and your rewards.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3>Miners&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="miners">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#miners" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q:&lt;/strong> Do I have anything to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A:&lt;/strong> No action is required. Pools will update automatically, and mining software doesn&amp;rsquo;t need upgrading. You can continue mining as before.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-11-06-governance-vote.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decisions are the most crucial part of advancing a project. Without them, ideas lie in-acted upon, development stalls, and instead of progress there is stagnation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bismuth Foundation is well aware of the dangerous path of inaction, and has always committed a full effort towards advancing the platform at a steadfast pace. One such large advancements have come into fruition recently, with the conclusion of Bismuth’s first Governance Vote- BGV-01.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BGV-01 was a motion that combined a new and revolutionary governance protocol with branching decisions that would impact Bismuth on a grand scale – retain the current emission schedule (option A), or significantly reduce it (option B). Throughout October 1st and November 1st of 2019, Bismuth stakeholders could vote on either choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results were resoundingly in favor of an inflation cut – option B, with a weight of over 89%, with the remainder 9.5% in support of option A and 1.5% choosing neither. A grand total of 68,952 Bismuth was committed to voting in BGV-01, an extraordinary figure proving the community’s willingness to partake in such motions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From block 1,450,000, BGV-01 option B will be implemented to vastly lower inflation and supply dilution.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mining (PoW) Block rewards would be lowered from 9.7 to 5.5 (reduction of 43%), but the curve is then decreasing slower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hypernodes (PoS) rewards would begin to decrease instead of being constant.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Overall dilution would be reduced from 30.0% to 19.4%, and decrease up to a tail emission of 2% after 10 years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long-term lower limits on the rewards have been introduced to give miners and Hypernode owners incentives to remain in the ecosystem.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With &lt;strong>Option B&lt;/strong> the annual inflation per year starting from &lt;strong>block height 1,450,000&lt;/strong> would be:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Time&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Percentage&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>

&lt;td>19.4%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 8&lt;/td>
&lt;td>3.8%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>2.9%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 10&lt;/td>
&lt;td>2.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h3>Implications:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="implications">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#implications" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For holders: less dilution, one of the components of the sell pressure goes down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For Hypernodes owners: no immediate change in the rewards, but on the long run Hypernodes rewards will decrease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Still, because of the dilution drop, the Hypernodes yield in the beginning will be higher than the overall dilution rate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For miners: reduction of rewards short term, but more rewards after some time (block height 5,300,000).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For dApps: no changes to fees or block times.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The new graph showing the miner, hypernode and dev rewards are shown below. In addition to the reduced emission, lower limits of 0.5 BIS have been put in place for both the miner and hypernode rewards. Since the dev reward is 10% of the miner reward, the lower limit on those will be 0.05 BIS per block. The lower limit will be reached at approximately block height 7,100,000.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-11-06-first-governance-vote.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bismuth’s first governance vote was a great success, and the community has spoken to alter Bismuth’s emission schedule for the better. Not only has a major change been decided upon, but it has proven that the BGV protocol is a far more viable and effective voting mechanism compared to what other platforms have created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All exchanges, pools and hypernode operators need to update their nodes by block height 1,450,000 which is expected to take place on November 27, 2019. The new release will be available at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bismuth Github repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-10-18-voting.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Bismuth community is currently voting whether or not change the supply emission (see BGVP-1).
In order to allow easy and un-restricted access to the vote, the team went for a full client side helper to generate voting transactions.
This ensures full privacy and allows to vote from any wallet. External help was welcome to get it successfully running and a Bounty will be awarded.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The voting helper&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-voting-helper">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-voting-helper" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The voting helper works by using a BIP-39 passphrase as an entropy source, deriving keys (alike a HD wallet) for your voting addresses, then disposable keys for every motion you vote upon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a UX point of view: a single passphrase to remind, and you have access to any voting key you&amp;rsquo;(ll ever need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Handling these key generation and transaction assembling on the client side, in a browser, allows for easy and secure access (it’s hosted on Github pages: Bismuth Voting Helper, but can also be run locally or on an air gapped computer) whatever the user OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Help was needed&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="help-was-needed">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#help-was-needed" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Bismuth is a Python centered coin, and the team devs do not have extensive experience with JS development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A call for help was made to the community, in order to get some back up.
We needed a proper scaffold, help with syntax, gluing things together, building and distribution of the helper…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The specs were written, a Python implementation was working, we needed more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Third party dev to the rescue&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="third-party-dev-to-the-rescue">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#third-party-dev-to-the-rescue" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Hopefully it was not long until &lt;a href="https://x.com/aravindballa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@aravindballa&lt;/a> said hi and gave a hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to his kind and professional help, the helper was up and running in time for day 1 of the vote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team did work on the core crypto engine, and Aravind helped scaffold, design, package, test… the whole thing to have it working and usable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aravind’s experience proved most useful and the Bismuth team is very grateful for his help!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Bounty&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="bounty">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#bounty" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A few tips have been sent via the discord Bot, but did not reflect Aravind’s work and implication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 1000 $BIS bounty will be awarded from the dev funds for the help so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Conclusion&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="conclusion">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#conclusion" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>It was really amazing to witness the power and dedication of the Bismuth and open source community.
State you problem, ask for help, and you can get invaluable help from users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the kind of experience that gives faith in a community and let foresee nice things for the future!&lt;/p>

New features in cryptocurrency privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>What are shielded tokens?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="what-are-shielded-tokens">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#what-are-shielded-tokens" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Shielded tokens are a set of secondary layer operations on the Bismuth blockchain that focus on privacy and are the pilot in the Epitax privacy research program of Bismuth. They are not like any other existing privacy cryptocurrency.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>How does it work?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="how-does-it-work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#how-does-it-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>You can imagine shielded tokens as password-protected assets. They are a continuation of the group key concept. Passwords are what sets apart those who have access to all transactions from those who have access to no transactions of a given shielded token.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These transactions can also be sent and received unencrypted, but without password, such transactions are unverifiable, which means that the final receiving party must confirm legitimity. This is possible because transactions can exist without verification on the secondary layer, unlike in the primary layer. Those are to be known as ambiguous transactions, formerly referred to as slave key transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To the network, a shielded token transaction looks like the sender is sending some encrypted data to themselves. Recipients can start looking up transactions by identifying signals, of which every asset has a certain amount available. Those transactions must then be decrypted with password of the given token.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Advantages&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="advantages">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#advantages" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Complete anonymity of recipients, senders, amounts, name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ambiguous transfers can be made without knowledge of a password&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No trusted setup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No group signatures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No range proofs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No security threat for the primary layer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Minimal computational power requirements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consistency&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conditional deniability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No interference with privacy classification of the main chain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-10-18-voting.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Preamble - This blog article explains the &lt;strong>BGV-01&lt;/strong> motion and the options you can vote for.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Abstract&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="abstract">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#abstract" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Motion: Keep Bismuth supply emission as it currently is (A) , or significantly reduce emission – therefore option (B).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Voting period: From 2019-10-01 at 12h00 UTC to 2019-11-01 at 12h00 UTC (block time counts)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vote reveal: From 2019-11-01 at 12h00 UTC to 2019-11-10 at 12h00 UTC&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a hardfork is decided, it could take place at block height 1,450,000, approximately on 2019-11-27&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>(draft timeline has been updated with final values)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Background&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="background">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#background" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Changing the supply emission of Bismuth is not something to be taken lightly. There are many arguments in favor of both options. Hence, the members of the Bismuth Foundation have decided to make this decision the first community vote to be carried out. There will be two options to vote for:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A) Keep the status quo, ie. keep the emissions curve as it is currently programmed, or:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B) Modify the block rewards to significantly reduce the overall dilution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Option A: BGV-01/A&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="option-a-bgv-01a">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#option-a-bgv-01a" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Do not change the supply, keep emission like it currently is, see the supply post.
With Option A the annual dilution per year measured in $BIS starting from block height 1,450,000 (2.5 years into the project) would be:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Year&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Percentage&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>30.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>21.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>15.6%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 4&lt;/td>
&lt;td>11.9%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 5&lt;/td>
&lt;td>9.3%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 6&lt;/td>
&lt;td>7.3%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 7&lt;/td>
&lt;td>5.6%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 8&lt;/td>
&lt;td>4.2%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>3.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 10&lt;/td>
&lt;td>2.2%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h3>Option B: BGV-01/B&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="option-b-bgv-01b">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#option-b-bgv-01b" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Radically change the supply emission from block 1,450,000 to lower the dilution and part of the market sell pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mining (PoW) Block rewards would be lowered from 9.7 to 5.5 (reduction of 43%), but the curve is then decreasing slower.
Hypernodes (PoS) rewards would begin to decrease instead of being constant.
Overall dilution would be reduced from 30.0% to 19.4%, and decrease up to a tail emission of 2% after 10 years.
Long-term lower limits on the rewards have been introduced to give miners and Hypernode owners incentives to remain in the ecosystem.
With Option B the annual inflation per year starting from block height 1,450,000 would be:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Year&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Percentage&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>19.4%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>14.9%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>11.7%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 4&lt;/td>
&lt;td>9.4%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 5&lt;/td>
&lt;td>7.6%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 6&lt;/td>
&lt;td>6.1%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 7&lt;/td>
&lt;td>4.9%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 8&lt;/td>
&lt;td>3.8%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>2.9%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Year 10&lt;/td>
&lt;td>2.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Implications:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For holders: less dilution, one of the components of the sell pressure goes down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For Hypernodes owners: no immediate change in the rewards, but on the long run Hypernodes rewards will decrease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Still, because of the dilution drop, the Hypernodes yield in the beginning will be higher than the overall dilution rate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For miners: reduction of rewards short term, but more rewards after some time (block height 5,300,000).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For dApps: no changes to fees or block times.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>Graph: (A) vs (B)&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="graph-a-vs-b">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#graph-a-vs-b" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The current emission curves (Option A) and the proposed modified curves (Option B) and the associated dilution rates are compared in the figure below:
Current emission (A) is in Bold, emission for (B) is thinner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-09-10-bgv_01_vote_alternatives.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Use of the winning funds&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="use-of-the-winning-funds">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#use-of-the-winning-funds" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>As described in the Bismuth &lt;a href="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/blog/2019-08-30-governance-shift-part_2/" >voting protocol&lt;/a>, the BIS of the losing side are sent back to their originating wallets, while funds of the winning side are kept in a fund to finance the option.
For this motion the winning funds – whatever the issue will be – are to be used as exchange listing and dapps bounties funds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Arguments&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="arguments">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#arguments" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3>Arguments for option A:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="arguments-for-option-a">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#arguments-for-option-a" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cryptocurrencies are supposed to be different from fiat currencies, where central banks regularly adjust monetary policies. See for example this article, where one of the conclusions is: “… cryptocurrencies offer a unique opportunity to engineer long term monetary policy that is carried out in full transparency. Unfortunately, many protocols we’ve looked at do not take advantage of this opportunity, or are prone to change (which defeats the purpose).”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Option B, although seemingly radical towards the miners (initial 43% reduction), shifts the emissions curve by approximately one year. The Bismuth Foundation has a long-term perspective, and one year means very little in the grand scheme.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The miners play a very important role, by securing the chain with their hash power, and building it in the first place. The PoS chain wouldn’t exist without the PoW chain, and Bismuth is – at core – a PoW chain.
By reducing the miners rewards (Option B) there is a high probability that the overall hash power will be reduced. With a reduced overall hash power in the network, the Bismuth blockchain will become more vulnerable to a 51% attack. Should such an attack occur, it is likely to be detrimental for the $BIS price.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bismuth is mainly a PoW coin, with no premine or ICO. It is meaningless to compare its supply model or dilution to pure PoS models, ICOs or premined coins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supply is just one component of sell pressure. Holders selling when market goes down also play a significant role in sell pressure. Everyone’s time would be put to better use in building the demand side up rather than trying short term hacks with supply.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Market could play a more important role than the supply curve. No need to play against the market, better wait for a purge and the next bull run.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In order to reduce the dilution, option B requires the PoS rewards – part of the dilution – to decrease instead of being constant. This can be seen as a time bomb for Hypernode owners, unless use-cases based upon the Hypernodes do add new income sources to Hypernode owners.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Option A would not require a hardfork, so there is less work for all the network participants (exchanges, pools, Hypernode owners) which all would have to update their nodes if Option B is selected.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>Arguments for option B:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="arguments-for-option-b">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#arguments-for-option-b" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>By significantly reducing the miners block rewards – hence dilution – the staking yield for Hypernode owners will initially become net positive (larger than the dilution caused by new coins).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By reducing the block rewards some believe that the supply reduction and increased scarcity will help recover the $BIS price, which has fallen significantly in recent times.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the $BIS price would increase by a factor 2x or more after the supply reduction, the miners would be better off measured in USD compared to before, since the miners’ rewards measured in $BIS will initially be reduced by a factor of less than 2x.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Option B introduces a long-term lower limit of Hypernode rewards of 0.5 $BIS per block to ensure that the block rewards can never reach zero, meaning the Hypernode owners have an incentive to stay in the ecosystem, in case future fees from use-cases are not sufficient or too irregular.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Option B introduces a long-term lower limit of the miners reward of 0.5 $BIS per block to ensure that the block rewards can never reach zero, meaning that the hash power will not disappear in case future network fees are not sufficient or too irregular to reward the miners.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With Option B the developer rewards do not go to zero either, but have a lower limit of 0.05 $BIS per block (10% of the miners block rewards), giving the core team a long-term incentive to keep working on and improving the blockchain, it’s ecosystem, as well as a marketing and exchange listing budget.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many blockchain projects have modified their emissions curves recently, including Ethereum which is ranked 2nd in terms of marketcap value. It is believed that these modifications have been made to become more comparable with Bitcoin’s dilution rates. Bitcoin being the first cryptocurrency, has had many years a headstart on other projects, and it has reached the tail end of it’s emission curve. It can be argued that Bismuth must modify its emissions curve too, or be left behind.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-08-30-governance-shift-part_2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Preamble&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="preamble">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#preamble" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In the previous post, the governance shift that is to take place with Bismuth was introduced, and the ETH voting protocol was examined. It was shown that this protocol does come with several issues that could be important flaws in the Bismuth context.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Issues with the ETH voting protocol&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="issues-with-the-eth-voting-protocol">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#issues-with-the-eth-voting-protocol" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is nothing at stake. You do not directly win or lose anything by voting (just some gas)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exchanges as well as shared services, dev funds, and founders have a huge voting power&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The holders are by definition the ones getting the most votes, so the issue is likely to be in favor of the holders group, and potentially detrimental to others and the coin in general.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since the votes are public, it allows for any kind of psychological manipulation by influence groups. You could pretend to vote for the other group, so other users are not incited to vote as it appears there is a clear winner. Then swap votes at the very last moment. Influence groups can play mind games.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do not vote “your best”, you just vote enough so your group wins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can bribe big balances who do not care to vote for your group, they have nothing to lose, so why not take the bribe and vote?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many users could also be bribed to vote against their long term interest: they would get the bribe right now, and have nothing immediate to lose.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the case of Bismuth, mean exchanges – including Cryptopia’s inactive wallet – or one entity – including the core team – could vote and have chances to impose their own decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>An alternate voting protocol&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="an-alternate-voting-protocol">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#an-alternate-voting-protocol" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Now comes a description of the Bismuth Governance Voting Model (BGVM). The goal is to have voters put their money where their mouth is. With this protocol:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You only vote for something you really want to happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do take risks, you have to show your motivation. Your vote is not an empty word, the core team is not the only one wetting the shirt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every category has a similar weight and cost to vote. Big balances are not over-represented.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Still, the richest wallets can have the most weight, and are also the ones benefiting from a higher future price.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You help finance the project you voted for.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no bribe advantage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you lose, you can still be happy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no possible mind games nor manipulation until the vote is over.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The voters involvement is known in real time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The issue of the vote is secret until it is finished.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>«Bismuth defines a new voting protocol: users have to put their money where their mouth is. Involvement is known in real time but the issue of the vote is secret until over!

&lt;a href="#the-protocol" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The public interface of the protocol is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A motion is proposed, with 2 or more options.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You vote by sending $BIS + data to the vote address. The amount you send is public, whereas data (your vote) is encrypted and private.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The $BIS you send are your voting weight. Their use – should the motion pass – are stated in the motion.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4>Options:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="options">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#options" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can issue several voting transactions, so you can increase your weight during the voting period.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you can invert a previous transaction vote (but not cancel it) should you change your mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Once the voting period is finished:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Votes – and related flips – are revealed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you do not reveal your vote, it cannot be counted, and you do not get your money back.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Losers get their $BIS back (less transaction fees).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the winners’ case, their $BIS go into a community fund to be used as stated by the motion.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>Pros&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="pros">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#pros" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is no need to bribe people, you would have to bribe them more than by voting yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There will be no mind games, the issue is totally opaque until the end. Even the core team does not have access to the results before votes are revealed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You take risks, and only vote for what you really want, because if this happens, your $BIS vote will be used to build it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no incentive in voting for the other side, since if it wins, you lose your tokens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trolls and fudders have no voice, no leverage. Only final $BIS votes count, once revealed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s safer for big holders with funds in cold wallet: you don’t have to move your cold funds out to vote. Just vote what you want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Involvement (total amount of $BIS) is known in real time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No need to run a balance vote on one side, then a miner vote by block signaling on the other side: everyone votes with the same protocol, the same unit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You know what the minimum proposal budget will be (at worse, 50.01% of the votes for a vote with 2 options).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every group has the same voting cost/power. Holders do not have more power than miners because they have a higher balance. What everyone bets for is what they risk, should they win. If the miners’ group want to overrule the holders, they do not need to have as much balance as the holders, they just need to vote as much as them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount you vote reflects your belief and involvement in the proposal you vote for, and what you are willing to contribute to see it succeed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-08-29-governance-shift-part_1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
During the first two and a half years of the Bismuth blockchain project, important governance actions have been decided by the group of foundation members. Now the core team finds it is time to involve the community deeper into governance questions, and make more use of community feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bismuth project has had a very active Discord community since the beginning, and it is seen as a very valuable resource for the project and it makes sense to consult the community more than in the past for input on important decisions. Therefore, the foundation members have decided to introduce a shift in the governance, by letting the stakeholders involved vote on important decisions concerning the future of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discord alone however can’t be seen as a source of actionable feedback:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Not everyone is active there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some voices do flood day after day with the same suggestions (count as one, no matter how many times you repeat yourself).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not all suggestions are well presented and actionable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can’t map a discord user to a Bismuth User (unless some flavor or KYC or associated wallets with Discord ids).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Twitter polls are also totally un-trustable:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Like with Discord, you do not reach everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can’t map a Twitter user to a Bismuth user (unless KYC/ de-pseudonymization).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Twitter polls are easily manipulable, there are plenty of services to buy votes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, the core team came to realize that if Discord is ok to gather some feedback and proposals, if everyone’s voice is to be heard and a decision in the common interest is to be taken, the voting process has to go further than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until then, the Bismuth team was the only responsible entity for core changes, like the introduction of the Hypernodes and related rewards, and later on, the move of some part of the mining reward toward Hypernodes. The Team always had in mind the long term success of the project, and took every class of user point of view into account before deciding: investors, miners, devs, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the core team feels that the time has come to let users hold their responsibilities and take the decision for everyone’s best interest, via a voting process. The team would prepare options to vote upon, the users will decide, the team will take action based on the final voting results.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The first vote in Bismuth History&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-first-vote-in-bismuth-history">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-first-vote-in-bismuth-history" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>If you are familiar with the discord, you cannot avoid the economists lobbying for a supply modification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The latest fork (&lt;a href="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/blog/2019-05-17-hard-fork-v4.3.0.0/" >see here&lt;/a>) was tailored to account for increased services to be provided by the Hypernodes, while not raising the dilution. It already went in the direction of reducing miner rewards. Currently the most vocal suggestions aim to address the dropping price concern, and are to significantly reduce the supply by cutting the emission: that is both block rewards and HN rewards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team ran simulations, examined the available data but still it is not clear what the global implications can be, nor how action or inaction would be welcome by the users and the markets. The problem really is complex with implications at the ethical, economical level, involving the equilibrium of the whole system. The more you dig, the more it appears complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It looks like it is the perfect case where a community vote is needed and will make sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A voting process can be an equally daunting task, because blockchain based voting is tricky and dangerous. The difficulty is two fold:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>A – What is “one” vote?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="a--what-is-one-vote">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#a--what-is-one-vote" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Blockchains usually are non-KYC (Know Your Customer) and anonymous or pseudonymous. One user can have many addresses. Some do require KYC (Like Tezos), that’s a road the core team does not want to take. So you never can map one vote to one user. Even if you could, voters could be bribed.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is a vote one address?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One coin?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One IP address?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One hash unit? In any case, you could pretend you have several voices when all are yours.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>B – Will I vote for the best common interest?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="b--will-i-vote-for-the-best-common-interest">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#b--will-i-vote-for-the-best-common-interest" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In a blockchain context, you can have several classes of people with different objectives. For Bismuth for instance, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) utility token, you can think of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The miners.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The holders.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The dApps developers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The core foundation team.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each of these classes can have a different egoistic goal when speaking of chain governance. Just as a quick illustration, miners would like higher fees or block rewards, holders want less dilution and more marketing, dapps developers want low fees and fast blocks, core team wants the token to go mainstream, be secure and used in the real world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Game theory shows that this can lead to votes that are counter productive for the chain as a whole (see “tragedy of the commons“, this is somehow related).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Ethereum Case – Carbonvote&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="ethereum-case--carbonvote">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#ethereum-case--carbonvote" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Before presenting the proposed Bismuth voting model, an example vote based on the Ethereum blockchain is briefly discussed. In order to decide about the “ice age” issue, ETH owners could vote on a motion to delay it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did it work?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Every address could vote, address balance = vote weight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0 ETH sent, but consumes gas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You could change your vote anytime, or move ETH to change your vote weight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The current, real time state of the vote was public at carbonvote.com.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The core team feels this model has several flaws, that can be deduced from the voting protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gives advantage to holders, exchanges and service providers (the higher your wallet balance, the more your weight).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public votes, real time stats, means you can play mind games, swap votes last moment and heavily influence the whole process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Users do vote but take no real risk, no responsibility. They have nothing to gain or lose if they don’t care about the results.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can be bribed to vote.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In a next article, you’ll be presented the Bismuth Governance Voting Model (BGVM), which is a novel protocol to address fair voting in the context of blockchain governance, and addresses the issues we just saw with the naive protocol above.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-001.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
When designing the coin supply and rewards model for a cryptocurrency, there are many factors to take into consideration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Bismuth Coin Supply and Rewards Model&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="bismuth-coin-supply-and-rewards-model">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#bismuth-coin-supply-and-rewards-model" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Some of the factors are:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Amount to sell in ICO (Initial Coin Offering)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pre-mine amount&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Development rewards&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Miner rewards (for POW coins)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forger rewards (for POS coins)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hypernodes/Masternode rewards&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When the Bismuth project started, the following coin supply and rewards model was chosen:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>No ICO&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No pre-mine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Development rewards equal to 10% of miners rewards&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The figure below shows the initial rewards model in blue color.
The formula for the miners rewards was: &lt;code>15-x/1e6&lt;/code> where x is the block height. This means the mining reward was decreasing linearly with time, unlike the btc abrupt halvings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-002.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At block height 800,000 Bismuth’s Hypernodes were launched, and at the same time the rewards model was modified. The miners rewards formula was modified to make it decrease faster. As seen from the figure below (red curve) the miners rewards decrease twice as fast as previously while the 0.8 taken from the miners were allocated to Hypernode rewards instead (green curve below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-003.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At block height 1,200,000 Bismuth’s reward formulas were modified again, to reward hypernodes relatively more compared to miners, see the figure below. The amount of 1.6 BIS per block were subtracted from the miners reward and added to the hypernodes rewards. The overall inflation was reduced only marginally because of this change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-004.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Python code to calculate Bismuth’s coin supply is available at the following link:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/tree/master/CoinSupply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/tree/master/CoinSupply&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bismuth blockchain started May 1, 2017 and the inflation rates during the following 10 years are shown in the table below:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Year&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Inflation&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>∞&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>93.2%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>38.9%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>4&lt;/td>
&lt;td>25.5%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>5&lt;/td>
&lt;td>18.4%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>6&lt;/td>
&lt;td>13.9%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>7&lt;/td>
&lt;td>10.8%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>8&lt;/td>
&lt;td>8.4%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>6.6%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>10&lt;/td>
&lt;td>5.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>As seen from this table, the inflation is quite high initially while it rapidly drops to 5.0% in year 10. One reason for the relatively high initial inflation is the fact that Bismuth had no pre-mine or ICO: The total coin supply started at zero at the Genesis block (block height 0). Naturally, the inflation will initially be large with such a distribution model. Some motivations behind this coin supply and rewards model is to ensure a fair distribution model of Bismuth in the early phase, while at the same time attract miners to secure the chain with their hash rates. As the project matures, holding Bismuth for the long-term is encouraged by the rapidly falling inflation rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The long-term plan for Bismuth is to increase the usage of the Hypernodes, for dApps and other services. Hence, as the project matures, the Hypernode operators will be rewarded with an increasingly larger portion of the overall rewards compared to the miners. The Hypernode rewards are a constant 2.4 BIS per block while the miners rewards continuously decrease. However, as the platform matures and gets more and more used, fees from the user transactions will compensate the miners for the drop of emission. If the Bismuth project becomes successful, the miners revenue may actually increase over time because of the increased level of fees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction of Hypernodes to the Bismuth project has been an overall success so far, for the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It did not result in a lowering of the miners rewards too much&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It resulted in an attractive return-of-investment (ROI) for the Hypernode holders. At the time of writing it is around 28% annually&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It led to a large number of hypernodes, at the time of writing approximately 180 active nodes and as a result a significant percentage of locked supply&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>At the time of writing approximately 4.5m BIS or almost 25% of the entire coin supply is locked in collateral by the hypernodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Bitcoin Rewards, Coin Supply and Inflation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="bitcoin-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#bitcoin-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The Bismuth rewards and coin supply model is compared with Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was chosen for comparison, because this coin had no ICO and no pre-mine, just like Bismuth. The plots below show the Bitcoin block rewards which started at 50 BTC and halved every 210,000 blocks. The total coin supply in Bitcoin will eventually reach approximately 21 million BTC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-005.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-006.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bitcoin blockchain started January 2009 and the inflation rates during the following 10 years are shown in the table below:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Year&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Inflation&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>∞&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>100.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>50.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>4&lt;/td>
&lt;td>33.3%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>5&lt;/td>
&lt;td>12.1%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>6&lt;/td>
&lt;td>11.5%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>7&lt;/td>
&lt;td>10.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>8&lt;/td>
&lt;td>9.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>4.2%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>10&lt;/td>
&lt;td>4.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>As seen from this table, although the numbers are different, the reduction in inflation rate from year to year is quite similar between Bitcoin and Bismuth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Zcash Rewards, Coin Supply and Inflation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="zcash-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#zcash-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Another cryptocurrency which is interesting to compare with Bismuth is Zcash, since it is largely limited to GPU mining rigs, just like Bismuth. The block rewards in Zcash started on 0.000625 ZEC and ramped up linearly to a block reward of 12.5 ZEC occuring at block height 20,000. Just like Bitcoin, Zcash has a reward halving. The blocktime in Zcash is 2,5 minutes, four times faster than Bitcoin. Hence, to achieve the same coin supply as Bitcoin with an upper limit of 21 million ZEC, the halving period measured in blocks for Zcash is every 840,000 blocks, 4 times higher than Bitcoin’s halving period. The halving period measured in days is the same for Zcash as for Bitcoin, since both the blocktime and the halving period have the factor 4 and cancel each other out. From the initial reward of 12.5 ZEC, 2.5 ZEC or 20% goes to the founders (core developers), as compared to 10% for the Bismuth project. The following two figures show the linear ramp up in Zcash block rewards and the total coin supply vs. block height.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-007.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-008.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Zcash blockchain started on October 28, 2016 and the inflation rates during the following 10 years are shown in the table below:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Year&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Inflation&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>∞&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>105.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>51.2%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;p>As seen from this table the inflation model in Zcash is the same as Bitcoin. However, since Zcash is a relatively new project it will have quite high inflation rates in 2019 (about 50%) compared to Bitcoin which has an inflation of less than 4.0% in 2019, since it is a much more mature project which has reached year 10 in the inflation curve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Ethereum Rewards, Coin Supply and Inflation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="ethereum-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#ethereum-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The cryptocurrency Ethereum has taken a different approach to block rewards. Initially, the block reward started out at 5 ETH. At block height 4,370,000 the reward dropped to 3 ETH in the Byzantium hardfork. At the upcoming Constantinople hardfork the plan is to reduce the block reward further to 2 ETH, see &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112015105/https://ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-developers-cut-rewards-curb-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EWN Article&lt;/a>. At the time of writing this reward reduction has not yet happened, but for the analysis below we will assume that this adjustment will be made at block height 7,500,000 and stay at 2 ETH indefinitely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With these assumptions the Ethereum block rewards and the total coin supply vs. block height are shown in the two figures below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ethereum differs from Bitcoin, Zcash and Bismuth because it had an &lt;strong>initial ICO&lt;/strong> of &lt;strong>72 million ETH&lt;/strong>, while the other 3 projects did not have an ICO. Ethereum is also different with block rewards which are not programmed to decrease, as is the case with Bitcoin, Zcash and Bismuth. So far, reduction of ETH block rewards has required hardforks, and it has only happened once so far (Byzantium) and another one planned (Constantinople). The use of an ICO (or pre-mine) results naturally in lower inflation rates for the following years. However, investors in such a project have to trust that the developers fund is not constantly sold on the market, otherwise that could have the same effect as a large inflation. It can be noted that Bismuth’s reward curve is a combination of the methods used by Bitcoin and Ethereum: 1) Programmed, falling reward curve as the block height increases and 2) Adjustment of inflation level at a few distinct block heights (hard forks).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Grin Rewards, Coin Supply and Inflation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="grin-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#grin-rewards-coin-supply-and-inflation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Grin is a new cryptocurrency project launched in 2019. The currency has 1 minute block time, 60 GRIN block reward and no limit on coin supply or reward halving. There are no ICO, founders reward, pre-mine or masternodes available for this project. The block reward stays at 60 GRIN indefinitely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The block rewards and the total coin supply vs. block height for GRIN are shown in the two figures below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-0011.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-07-03-supply-0012.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As can be seen from the plots above, GRIN is an inflationary cryptocurrency with no upper limit on the total coin supply. The inflation rates for such a currency, especially when the coin supply starts at zero, are naturally expected to be high. The table below shows the inflation rates for the first 10 years of this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GRIN blockchain started on January 15, 2019 and the inflation rates during the following 10 years are shown in the table below:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>

&lt;td>100.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>50.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>4&lt;/td>
&lt;td>33.3%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>5&lt;/td>
&lt;td>25.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>6&lt;/td>
&lt;td>20.0%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>7&lt;/td>
&lt;td>16.7%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>8&lt;/td>
&lt;td>14.3%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>12.5%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>10&lt;/td>
&lt;td>11.1%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>10 years into the projects, the cryptocurrencies studied in this blog have the following inflation levels:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ethereum = 3.3%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bitcoin = 4.0%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zcash = 4.0%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bismuth = 5.3%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GRIN = 11.1%&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The analysis shows that the Bismuth inflation can be considered as slightly above average in the crypto world. However, Bismuth’s block rewards are decreasing and the inflation rates are far below cryptocurrencies which start with a coin supply of zero and have constant block rewards, such as GRIN. Such projects will have an inflation rate at 11.1% after 10 years, more than double Bismuth’s inflation rate at that time. Note also that mature projects like Bitcoin, which have existed for 10 years or more, will naturally have lower inflation levels than younger projects which have only existed for a few years. The use of an initial ICO or pre-mine will also make the inflation numbers smaller, however this observation may be deceptive if the developers are constantly selling coins to fund their work or take out profits from the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not everyone sees inflation as bad. In this article (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/dogecoin-to-allow-annual-inflation-of-5-billion-coins-each-year-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/dogecoin-to-allow-annual-inflation-of-5-billion-coins-each-year-forever/&lt;/a>) for example it is stated: As long as it’s at a steady and predictable rate, you would want that inflation rate to more or less match the growth of the global economy, James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University, told Ars. In order for a currency to survive, it’s got to be useful. One of the problems we learned with gold standard was that it’s too inflexible – it takes too long for gold miners to dig it up out of the ground. Having a nice, steady, predictable money supply is actually a good thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inflation rates of different cryptocurrencies have, in general, little effect on the price movement of the coins. The table below shows the annual price movement of the coins during the period 2013-2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Year&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Bitcoin&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Bismuth&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Zcash&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Ethereum&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;td>442%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2014&lt;/td>
&lt;td>-59%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2015&lt;/td>
&lt;td>38%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>-64%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2016&lt;/td>
&lt;td>123%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>742%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2017&lt;/td>
&lt;td>1319%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>226%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>905%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>918%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2018&lt;/td>
&lt;td>-82%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>-92%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>-88%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>-82%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>From the data shown above there seems to be little correlation between a cryptocurrency’s inflation levels and the future price movement. For example, during the period 2016-2018 the cryptocurrency Ethereum had a 6 times higher price increase measured in USD compared to Bitcoin, despite the fact that Ethereum had a doubling in the coin supply during this period compared to only 18% increase in the coin supply for Bitcoin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other factors, such as promised and delivered features, stability of the blockchain, marketing efforts and the quality and size of the development team are believed to have a much higher influence on the price movements than inflation levels and total coin supply.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://alias-bitsignal.github.io/images/2019-05-17-BIS-HARD-FORK-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />
Over the past couple of months, Bismuth has undergone major shifts- technologically, socially, and economically. We witnessed a massive upgrade and restructuring of the core code that spanned over 200 commits, that was finalized in version 4.2.9.2 in late March of this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fast forward to the start of May, and we made our first announcement for Hyperlanes- an infinitely scaling form of direct data exchange between nodes which enables the inter-connectivity of the future- coined “Internet Within Blockchain”. We have made strides in expanding our team to include new members that are actively assisting in areas where we were weakest. Although most of this goes under the radar, the effects of it all should be felt over the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Economically and socially, the overall bear market has caused much turmoil within the entirety of the cryptocurrency community. The Bismuth project wasn’t spared and unfortunately received the brunt of the market downturn as we have witnessed a precipitous drop from the peak in early 2018. Although the Bismuth foundation cannot exert control over the free market, there are factors and variables that can be adjusted by the development team when consensus within the community is reached. One of such factors is the inflation question, which has been widely debated within our social channels and internally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inflation is a delicate topic, as it is both one of the prime drivers in market forces, as well as the incentive that helps propagate the blockchain and network forward. It is an issue that must be approached with care, as radical changes can result in degrading the robust security Bismuth has built-up over the past couple of years. However, inflation itself can drastically sabotage the market if left unchecked. This has left the Bismuth foundation to develop a strategic hard fork that takes all factors into mind while moving forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On block 1,200,000 (early June), a strategic hard fork has been scheduled that introduces new emission rules for mining and the Hypernode network. The hard fork will introduce a strategic miner reward reduction that shifts the inflation curve more than 18 months forward. This reduction will set the miner block reward to be 1.6 BIS less than the current emission rate, which equates to an immediate &lt;strong>13.5% reduction&lt;/strong> in miner emission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the contrary, the hard fork will bring forth a substantial increase to Hypernode reward payouts. A flat 200% increase in emission will be introduced, bringing up the current per-block reward of 0.8 BIS to 2.4 BIS. The current ROI for running a Hypernode is &lt;strong>11.7% per annum&lt;/strong>, which was unsatisfactory when compared to the net inflation. With the introduction of the reward hike, this figure gets bumped up to &lt;strong>35.1% per annum&lt;/strong>, and makes Bismuth a viable investment vehicle for prospective individuals that wish to run Hypernodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the number of active Hypernodes increase, the network will reciprocally become more competitive and the expected profitability will decrease. However, to reach the old ROI rate of 11.7% per annum, the Hypernode network capacity would have to increase by 7,200,000 BIS, not counting the existing figure (3,250,000 BIS at time of writing) locked in Hypernodes. In total, over 58% of the current circulating supply would have to get locked in order to return to the old rate of 11.7%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the Hypernode network expands, it becomes a more and more viable parallel network for utilitarian purposes. Bismuth is the leading platform for Python development in the blockchain industry, and Python itself is the world’s most popular and fastest growing programming language. With those factors coupled together, the Bismuth project retains some of the largest growth potential in the entire industry, and can tap into the intellectual capital of millions of Python developers. The possibilities are endless, as we move forward to build the virtual infrastructure that will provide the utility of the digital world.&lt;/p>

Solution to the codebase consensus conflict in context of the &lt;strong>Bismuth Blockchain&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The Problem&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-problem">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-problem" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In 2017, a new type of a 51% attack became prolific. It was not of technical, but of governance (political) nature. The resilience of cryptocurrencies is supposed to lie within decentralization of the network, but the code repository is a single point of failure which became the target for this new type of attack – forking and network hijacking, a type of consensus rule attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethereum proved that it is possible to fork a cryptocurrency network, arbitrarily change its contents and win majority of the participants through a public campaign. This opened the door to a new way of thinking – that it is no longer required to fork a codebase to start your own network, but instead it is possible and profitable to hijack an existing network and take
over its participants by promotion. Once the forked codebase wins the majority, it is de facto the winner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Existing Proposals&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="existing-proposals">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#existing-proposals" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A few solutions have been proposed by new projects, most prominent of them is Tezos. Tezos markets itself as the self-amending ledger, where participants can vote on proposals that are eventually integrated into the system. This is an improvement over the existing situation, which in my opinion does not address the problem in an ideal way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Semantic Interpretation Solution&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="semantic-interpretation-solution">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#semantic-interpretation-solution" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I hereby introduce the semantic interpretation approach to the singular codebase problem. In this model, the core system remains untouched and is governed by consensus. The semantic interpretation level exists above the core layer. There, both the secondary layer codebase storage and the way it is interpreted are subject to users. The main advantage is that it can endlessly fork, users can pick which code authors they want to express without influencing others and mainly without having any impact on the
primary level codebase. The main consensus remains the same and the semantic layer is not bound by shared state or enforced using traditional consensus rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Implementation of Secondary Layer&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="implementation-of-secondary-layer">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#implementation-of-secondary-layer" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;h4>Level 1: Passive Data&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="level-1-passive-data">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#level-1-passive-data" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>For a system like this, we need a blockchain which enables storage of arbitrary data. The data do not represent a contract of any type, only passive input. This is the first level of interpretation as all users can store data. They can be referred to as service providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Level 2: Active Interpretation Engines&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="level-2-active-interpretation-engines">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#level-2-active-interpretation-engines" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>On the side of the individual users, we need code that interprets the passive data and turns it into meaningful output. An application which analyzes blocks, looking for code the user is interested in. Service providers can distribute such applications, doing this task for the users, so they reach the desired level of communication between users and the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interpretation engines can then store output on the blockchain again.
This output can be recycled as passive data if desired. Interpretation engines can be thought of as individual contract executors and can be run by one or many nodes, depending on design and the need for particular sub-consensus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Level 3: Conflict Resolution&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="level-3-conflict-resolution">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#level-3-conflict-resolution" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Level 1 conflict is the basis for this system to work. Users do not strive for consensus, instead they choose which services they individually want to use, just like on the internet they pick which websites they want to visit. Therefore, nobody has any power over which data anyone else has to use or execute. They use the shared blockchain database for common storage and availability. Level 2 conflict is similar to a standard blockchain fork. If someone disagrees with an interpretation engine of of a provider and that engine is available openly, they can change it and offer it for the users, becoming a provider of a new solution. Both engines can continue running on the underlying blockchain without any security risks, even if users of a particular engine drop to 0 for any length of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Practical Example&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="practical-example">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#practical-example" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This scenario deals with a one node example for simplicity. Many node scenario includes handling of user resources whose interpretation does not require shared state consensus, such as tokens.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Part 1: Service Provider Emerges&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="part-1-service-provider-emerges">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#part-1-service-provider-emerges" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>User with address A decides to become a service provider of a newspaper. He starts a service by submitting news to the blockchain on daily basis, leveraging the availability advantages of such a solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Part 2: Data Storage and Interpretation Engine Creation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="part-2-data-storage-and-interpretation-engine-creation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#part-2-data-storage-and-interpretation-engine-creation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>The provider stores data to the blockchain in a particular form. In the interpretation process, the main trigger is his address and a specific command in the operation field. The news data is stored in the data field. He also creates an application which reads the previously stored data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Data for Interpretation Engine 1:&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="data-for-interpretation-engine-1">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#data-for-interpretation-engine-1" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>address: 123, operation: newspaper, data: banks bailout in 2019&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Interpretation Engine 1 pseudocode:&lt;/strong>
Select all data from blockchain where the address is 123, operation is ”newspaper” and block time ranges between last monday and today. Display data from data field to the user using a web interface available through the browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Part 3: Choice as Consensus Conflict&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="part-3-choice-as-consensus-conflict">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#part-3-choice-as-consensus-conflict" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Users A and B decide to download the application and use it. Users C and D ignore it, governance consensus is already split into two groups, one deeming the app worthy, the other one not. If the application was run from a traditional smart contract, this would result in a disruption of the consensus. No such scenario occurs with the Interpretation Engine.
After some time, a new provider decides to copy the Interpretation Engine and issue news in a different language. They change the source address to their own, find new users for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>address: 234, operation: newspaper_cz, data: finanční pomoc bankám v r. 2019 (Interpretation Engine 2)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A third provider chooses to edit this Interpretation Engine to only read news on Monday, utilizing the first data source, but changing the application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>address: 123, operation: newspaper, data: banks bailout in 2019 (Interpretation Engine 3)&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="#summary" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Interpretation Engines provide a viable solution to the governance problem and consensus centralization in the world of blockchain. Instead of looking for consensus, they intentionally break it without any consequences for the core levels where shared state is critical for operation. It is possible to use them to transfer data and value, run them from one or many nodes, introduce advanced trigger solutions or use one of the existing Bismuth applications as a guideline.&lt;/p>
